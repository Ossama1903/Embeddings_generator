14.1 MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO CURRENT
IN A LONG STRAIGHT WIRE
Take a straight, thick copper wire and pass it vertically
through a hole in a horizontal piece of cardboard. Place
small compass needles on the cardboard along a circle with
the centre at the wire. All the compass needles will point in
the direction of N - S. Now pass a heavy current through the
wire. It will be seen that the needles will rotate and will set
themselves tangential to the circle (Fig. 14.1 a). On reversing
the direction of current, the direction of needles is also
reversed. As the current through the wire is stopped, all the
needles again point along the N - S direction.
Following conclusions can be drawn from the above
mentioned experiment:
(i)
A magnetic field is set up in the region
surrounding a current carrying wire.
(ii)
The lines of force are circular and their
Fig. 14.1 (a)
direction depends upon the direction of
current.
(iii)
The magnetic field lasts only as long as the
current is flowing through the wire.
The direction of the lines of force can be found by a rule
concluded directly from the above experiment which is stated
as follows:
If the wire is grasped in fist of right hand with
the thumb pointing in the direction of the
current, the fingers of the hand will circle the
wire in the direction of the magnetic field.
This is known as right hand rule and is illustrated in
Fig. 14.1 (b).

which the conductor may experience a force. To demonstrate

When a current is passed through the copper rod from a

Convention to represent direction
It can be seen that the force on a current carrying conductor is
given both in magnitude and direction by the following
equation:
F=/LxB
(14.2)
where the vector L is in the direction of current flow. The
magnitude of the vector / L X B is I L B sina, where a is the
angle between the vector L and B. This gives the magnitude
of the force. The direction of the force F (Fig. 14.3) is also
correctly given by the right hand rule of the cross product of
N
vectors of L and B i.e., rotate L to coincide with B through the
smaller angle. Curl the fingers of right hand in the direction of
rotation. The thumb points in the direction of force. In some
situations the direction of the force is conveniently
determined by applying the following rule:
Consider a straight current carrying conductor held at right
angle to a magnetic field such that the current flows out of the
plane of paper i.e., towards the reader as shown in
Fig. 14.4. It is customary to represent a current flowing
towards the reader by a symbol dot (*) and a current flowing
away from him by a cross (x).
S
In order to find the direction of force, consider the lines of

the right side of it. The conductor tends to move towards the
weaker part of the field i.e., the force on the conductor will be
directed towards right in a direction at right angles to both the
59
---

conductor and the magnetic field. This rule is often referred as
extension of right hand rule. It can be seen that the direction of
the force is the same as given by the direction of the vector L B.
Example 14.1: A20.0 cm wire carrying a current of 10.0A Ais
placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.30 T. If the wire makes
an angle of 40° with the direction of magnetic field, find the
magnitude of the force acting on the wire.
Solution:
Length of the wire =L=20.0cm=0.20m
Current = I = 10.0A
Strength of magnetic field = B=0.30T
Angle = a=40°
Substituting these values in the equation

element of area A in a uniform magnetic field B is given by dot
product of B and A (Fig. 14.5).
(a)
OB = B.A
OR = BA cos0
(14.3)
Note that A is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the
element and whose direction is along the normal to the
surface of the element, 0 is the angle between the directions
A
of the vectors B and A.
B
In Fig. 14.5 (b) the field is directed along the normal to the
area, so 0 is zero and the flux is maximum, equal to BA.
When the field is parallel to the plane of the area (Fig. 14.5c),
(b)
the angle between the field and normal to area is 90° i.e.,
0 = 90°, so the flux through the area in this position is zero.
A
In case of a curved surface placed in a non uniform magnetic
field, the curved surface is divided into a number of small

surface elements, each element being assumed plane and
B
the flux through the whole curved surface is calculated by
sum of the contributions from all the elements of the surface.
From the definition of tesla, the unit of magnetic flux is NmA"
(c)

which is called weber (Wb).
60
---

According to Eq. 14.3, the magnetic induction B is the flux per
unit area of a surface perpendicular to B, hence it is also
called as flux density. Its unit is then, Wbm3. Therefore,
magnetic induction, i.e., the magnetic field strength is
measured in terms of Wbm" -2 or NA*m (tesla).
Example 14.2: The magnetic field in a certain region is
given by B = (40i-18k) Wbm2 How much flux passes through
a 5.0 cm2 area loop in this region if the loop lies flat in the
xy- plane?
Solution:
Magneticinduction=B=401-18k
Area of the loop = AA =5.0x10*m²
Flux (=Qg=B.AA
=(40i-18k).(5.0x10*m'k)
= 90x104
14.4 AMPERE'S LAW AND DETERMINATION
OF FLUX DENSITY B
We know that an electric current produces a magnetic field.
Ampere, after carrying out a series of experiments,
generalized his results into a law known as Ampere circuital
law by which the magnetic flux density B at any point due to a
current carrying conductor can be easily computed as
explained below:
B
Consider a closed path in the form a circle of radius
r
enclosing the current carrying wire (Fig.14.6). This closed
path is referred as Amperean path. Divide this path into small
AL
elements of length like AL. Let B be the value of flux density at
the site of AL. Determine the value of B.AL. If 0 is the angle
between B and AL, then

represents the product of the length of the element AL and
the component of B parallel to AL. Ampere stated that the
sum of the quantities B.AL for all path elements into which the
complete loop has been divided equals Ho times the total
current enclosed by the loop, where Ho is a constant, known

where (B.AL) is the value of B.AL along the r th element and
N is the total number of elements into which the loop has
been divided. This is known as Ampere's circuital law.

it can be neglected as compared to the field inside.
The value of magnetic filed B can be easily determined by
applying Ampere's circuital law. Consider a rectangular loop

14.5 FORCE ON A MOVING CHARGE INA
MAGNETIC FIELD
We have seen that a current carrying conductor, when placed
in a magnetic field, experiences a force. The current through
the conductor is because of the motion of charges. Actually
the magnetic field exerts force on these moving charges due
to which the conductor experiences force. We are interested
in calculating the force exerted on the moving charges.
B
Consider the situation as shown in Fig. 14.8 where we see a
portion of the wire that is carrying a current I. Suppose there
are n charge carriers per unit volume of the wire, and that
each is moving with velocity V as shown. We will now find how
A
long it takes for all the charge carriers originally in the wire
segment shown to exit through the end area A.
The volume of the wire segment is AL. Because there are n
charge carriers per unit volume, the number of charge carrier
Fig. 14.8
in the segment is n AL. If the charge on a charge carrier is q,
each of it, as it crosses the end area, will transport a charge q
through it. Assuming the speed of the carriers to be V, the
carrier entering the left face of the segment takes a time
At = L/v to reach the right hand face. During this time, all the
charge carriers originally in the segment, namely n AL, will
exit through the right hand face. As each charge carrier has a
charge q, the charge AQ that exits through the end area in
time At= L/vis

Then, from the definition of the current, the current I through

---

In Fig. 14.8, it can be seen that the direction of the segment L
is the same as the direction of the velocity of the charge
carriers. If L is a unit vector along the direction of the segment
L and V, a unit vector along the velocity vector V, then L=v
vL=vLL
=vvl=vL
Substituting the value of vL in Eq. 14.7, we have
F=nAq(vL)xB
=nALqvxB
n AL is the total number of charge carries in the segment L, so
the force experienced by a single charge carrier is
AL =
Thus the force experienced by a single charge carrier moving
with velocity V in magnetic field of strength B is
F=q(vxB)
(14.8)
Although the q.14.8 has been derived with reference to
charge carrier moving in a conductor but it does not involve
any parameter of the conductor, so the Eq. 14.8 is quite
general and it holds for any charge carrier moving in a
magnetic field.
If an electron is projected in a magnetic field with a velocity V,
it will experience a force which is given by putting q = - e in
Eq. 14.8 where e is the magnitude of the electronic charge.
F=-evxB
(14.9)
In case of proton, F is obtained by putting q = + e.
F=+evxB
(14.10)

B
Note that in case of proton or a positive charge the direction
of the force is given by the direction of the vector V X B i.e.,
rotate V to coincide with B through the smaller angle of
rotation and curl the fingers of right hand in the direction of
rotation. Thumb will point in the direction of the force. This is
illustrated in Fig. 14.9 in which the proton enters into a
magnetic field, as shown in figure, along the direction of
dotted line. It experiences a force in the upward direction as

may be noted that the magnitude of the force on a moving
charge carrier is qvBsine where 0 is the angle between the
velocity of the carrier and the magnetic field. It is maximum
when 0 = 90° i.e., when the charged particle is projected at
right angles to the field. It is zero when 0 = 0° i.e., a charged
particle projected in the direction of the field experiences no
force.

(14.13)
If V and r are known, e/m of the electron is determined. The
radius r is measured by making the electronic trajectory
visible. This is done by filling a glass tube with a gas such as
hydrogen at low pressure. This tube is placed in a region
occupied by a uniform magnetic field of known value. As
electrons are shot into this tube, they begin to move along a
circle under the action of magnetic force. As the electrons
move, they collide with atoms of the gas. This excites the
atoms due to which they emit light and their path becomes
visible as a circular ring of light (Fig. 14.12). The diameter of
the ring can be easily measured.
In order to measure the velocity V of the electrons, we should
know the potential difference through which the electrons are
accelerated before entering into the magnetic field. If V is
this potential difference, the energy gained by electrons

14.8 CATHODE RAY OSCILLOSCOPE
Cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is a very versatile electronic
instrument which is, in fact, a high speed graph plotting
device. It works by deflecting beam of electrons as they pass
through uniform electric field between the two sets of parallel
plates as shown in the Fig. 14.13(a). The deflected beam then
falls on a fluorescent screen where it makes a visible spot.

It can display graphs of functions which rapidly vary with time.
Fig. 14.13 (a)
It is called cathode ray oscilloscope because it traces the
desired waveform with a beam of electrons which are also
called cathode rays.
The beam of the electrons is provided by an electron gun
which consists of an indirectly heated cathode, a grid and
three anodes. The filament F heats the cathode C which
V
emits electrons. The anodes A1, A2, A3 which are at high
positive potential with respect to cathode, accelerate as well
as focus the electronic beam to fixed spot on the screen S.
The grid G is at a negative potential with respect to cathode. It
controls the number of electrons which are accelerated by
anodes, and thus it controls the brightness of the spot formed
on the screen.
Now we would explain how the waveform of various voltages
Saw tooth voltage waveform
is formed in CRO.
Fig. 14.13 (b)
The two set of deflecting plates, shown in Fig. 14.13(a) are
usually referred as X and y deflection plates because a
voltage applied between the X plates deflects the beam
horizontally on the screen i.e., parallel to x-axis. A voltage
applied across the y plates deflects the beam vertically on the
screen i.e., along the y-axis. The voltage that is applied
across the X plates is usually provided by a circuit that is built
in the CRO. It is known as sweep or time base generator. Its
output waveform is a saw tooth voltage of period T
(Fig. 14.13-b). The voltage increases linearly with time for a
period T and then drops to zero. As this voltage is impressed
across the X plates, the spot is deflected linearly with time
along the x-axis for a time T. Then the spot returns to its

voltage rapidly falls to its initial value at the end of each

---

period. We can actually see the spot moving on the x-axis. If
the time period T is very short, we see just a bright line on the
screen.
If a sinusoidal voltage is applied across the y plates when,
simultaneously, the time base voltage is impressed across
the X plates, the sinusoidal voltage, which itself gives rise to a
vertical line, will now spread out and will appear as a
sinusoidal trace on the screen. The pattern will appear
stationary only if the time T is equal to or is some multiple of
the time of one cycle of the voltage on y plates. It is thus
necessary to synchronize the frequency of the time base
generator with the frequency of the voltage at the y plates.
This is possible by adjusting the synchronization controls
provided on the front panel of the CRO.
(a)
Uses of CRO
The CRO is used for displaying the waveform of a given
voltage. Once the waveform is displayed, we can measure
the voltage, its frequency and phase. For example,
Fig. 14.14(a) shows the waveform of an alternating voltage.
As the y-axis is calibrated in volts and the x-axis in time, we
can easily find the instantaneous value and peak value of the
voltage. The time period can also be determined by using the
time calibration of x-axis. Information about the phase
difference between two voltages can be obtained by
simultaneously displaying their waveforms. For example, the
II
waveforms of two voltages are shown in Fig. 14.14(b). These
(b)
waveforms show that when the voltage of I is increasing, that
of II is decreasing and vice versa. Thus the phase difference
Fig. 14.14
between these voltages is 180°.
14.9 TORQUE ONA CURRENT CARRYING
COIL
Consider a rectangular coil carrying a current 1. The coil is
capable of rotation about an axis. Suppose it is placed in uniform
magnetic field B with its plane along the field (Fig. 14.15). We
know that a current carrying conductor of length L when placed
in a magnetic field experiences a force F = 1 B sinO where 0 is
the angle between conductor and the field. In case of sides AB
and CD of the coil, the angle 0 is zero or 180°, so the force on
these sides will be zero. In case of sides DA and BC, the angle 0
is 90° and the force on these sides will be

where L is the length of these sides, F, is the force on the side
DA and F2 on BC. The direction of the force is given by the
vector /LxB. It can be seen that F, is directed out of the plane
of paper and F2 2 into the plane of paper (Fig. 14.15 a).
Therefore, the forces F, and F2 being equal and opposite
form a couple which tends to rotate it about the axis. The

14.10 GALVANOMETER
A galvanometer is an electrical instrument used to
detect the passage of current. Its working depends upon
the fact that when a conductor is placed in a magnetic
field, it experience a force as soon as a current passes
through it. Due to this force, a torque T acts upon the
conductor if it is in the form of a coil or loop.
=NIBA cosa
where N is the number of turns in the coil, A is its area, I is
current passing through it, B is the magnetic field in which the
coil is placed such that its plane makes an angle a with the
direction of B. Due to action of the torque, the coil rotates and
71
---

o
thus it detects the current. The construction of a moving coil
galvanometer is shown in Fig. 14.16 (a).
A rectangular coil C is suspended between the concave
F
shaped poles N and S of a U-shaped magnet with the help of
a fine metallic suspension wire. The rectangular coil is made
M
of enameled copper wire. It is wound on a frame of non-
magnetic material. The suspension wire F is also used as
one current lead to the coil. The other terminal of the coil is
C
connected to a loosely wound spiral E which serves as the
second current lead. A soft iron cylinder D is placed inside the
N
D
S
coil to make the field radial and stronger near the coil as
shown in Fig. 14.1 16 (b).
When a current is passed through the coil, it is acted upon by
a couple which tends to rotate the coil. This couple is known
as deflecting couple and is given by NIBA cosa. As the coil is
placed in a radial magnetic field in which the plane of the coil
is always parallel to the field (Fig. 14.16 b), so a is always
zero. This makes cosa = 1 and thus,
Deflecting couple = NIBA
As the coil turns under the action of deflecting couple,
the suspension wire Fig. (14.16a a) is twisted which gives
rise to a torsional couple. It tends to untwist the
suspension and restore the coil to its original position.
(a)
This couple is known as restoring couple. The restoring
couple of the suspension wire is proportional to the
angle of deflection 0 as long as the suspension wire
obeys Hooke's law. Thus
Restoring torque=c0
where the constant C of the suspension wire is known as
N
S
torsional couple and is defined as couple for unit twist.
(b)
Under the effect of these two couples, coil comes to rest

Thus the current passing through the coil is directly
proportional to the angle of deflection.
72
---

There are two methods commonly used for observing the
angle of deflection of the coil. In sensitive galvanometers the
angle of deflection is observed by means of small mirror
attached to the coil along with a lamp and scale arrangement
Fig.14.17). A beam of light from the lamp is directed towards
the mirror of the galvanometer. After reflection from the mirror
OM
it produces a spot on a translucent scale placed at a distance
of one metre from the galvanometer. When the coil rotates,
the mirror attached to coil also rotates and spot of light moves
08
along the scale. The displacement of the spot of light on the
scale is proportional to the angle of deflection (provided the
Fig. 14.17
angle of deflection is small).
The galvanometer used in school and college laboratories is
a pivoted type galvanometer. In this type of galvanometer,
the coil is pivoted between two jewelled bearings. The
restoring torque is provided by two hair springs which also
serve as current leads. A light aluminium pointer is attached
Upper spring
to the coil which moves over a scale (Fig. 14.18). It gives the
angle of deflection of the coil.
It is obvious from Eq.14.17 that a galvanometer can be made
Pointer
more sensitive (to give large deflection for a given current) if
Iron
coil
c/BAN is made small. Thus, to increase sensitivity of a
core
galvanometer, C may be decreased or B, A and N may be
increased. The couple C for unit twist of the suspension wire
can be decreased by increasing its length and by decreasing
Permanent
magnet
its diameter. This process, however, cannot be taken too far,
as the suspension must be strong enough to support the coil.
Lower spring
Another method to increase the sensitivity of galvanometer is
to increase N, the number of turns of the coil. In case of
Fig 14.18
suspended coil type galvanometer, the number of turns can
not be increased beyond a limit because it will make the coil
heavy. To compensate for the loss of sensitivity, in case
fewer turns are used in the coil, we increase the value of the
magnetic field employed. We define current sensitivity of a
galvanometer as the current, in microamperes, required to
produce one millimetre deflection on a scale placed one
metre away from the mirror of the galvanometer.
When the current passing through the galvanometer
is
discontinued, the coil will not come to rest as soon as the
current flowing through the coil is stopped. It keeps on
oscillating about its mean position before coming to rest. In
the same way if the current is established suddenly in a
galvanometer, the coil will shoot beyond its final equilibrium
position and will oscillate several times before coming to rest
73
---

at its equilibrium position. As it is annoying and time
consuming to wait for the coil to come to rest, artificial ways
are employed to make the coil come to rest quickly. Such
galvanometer in which the coil comes to rest quickly after the
current passed through it or the current is stopped from
flowing through it, is called stable or a dead beat
galvanometer.
Ammeter
An ammeter is an electrical instrument which is used to
measure current in amperes. This is basically a
R,
galvanometer. The portion of the galvanometer whose
motion causes the needle of the device to move across the
scale is usually known as meter - movement. Most meter

is
movements are very sensitive and full scale deflection is
S
obtained with a current of few milliamperes only. So an
ordinary galvanometer cannot be used for measuring large
15-1-1
currents without proper modification.
/
Suppose we have a galvanometer whose meter - movement
(coil) has a resistance R9 and which gives full scale deflection
when current Io is passed through it. From Ohm's law we

galvanometer which is shunted by a

to pass through the galvanometer is given by
Vg=14R
If we want to convert this galvanometer into an ammeter
which can measure a maximum current I, it is necessary to
connect a low value bypass resistor called shunt. The shunt
resistance is of such a value so that the current Ig for full scale
deflection of the galvanometer passes through the
galvanometer and the remaining current (I - Id passes
through the shunt in this situation (Fig. 14.19)
The shunt resistance R, can be calculated from the fact that
as the meter - movement and the shunt are connected in
parallel with each other, the potential difference across the
meter - movement is equal to the potential difference across
the shunt.
10 Rg ,=(I-I)R,
or
(14.18)
The resistance of the shunt is usually so small that a piece of
74
---

copper wire serves the purpose. The resistance of the
ammeter is the combined resistance of the galvanometer's
meter - movement and the shunt. Usually it is very small. An
ammeter must have a very low resistance so that it does not
disturb the circuit in which it is connected in series in order to
measure the current.
Voltmeter
A voltmeter is an electrical device which measures the
potential difference in volts between two points. This, too, is
made by modifying a galvanometer. Since a voltmeter is
R,
R2
always connected in parallel, it must have a very high
resistance so that it will not short the circuit across which the
voltage is to be measured. This is achieved by connecting a
very high resistance Rn placed in series with the meter -
V
movement (Fig.14.20). Suppose we have a meter -
movement whose resistance is Rg and which deflects full

which has a range of V volts, the value of the high resistance
R should be such that full scale deflection will be obtained
when it is connected across V volt. Under this condition the
current through the meter - movement is Ig. Applying Ohm's
law (Fig. 14.20) we have
V=1,(R+R)
Rh = I V
(14.19)
g
If the scale of the galvanometer is calibrated from 0 to
V volts, the combination of galvanometer and the series
resistor acts as a voltmeter with range 0 - V volts. By properly
arranging the resistance R1 any voltage can be measured.
Thus, we see that a voltmeter possesses high resistance.
It may be noted that a voltmeter is always connected across
the two points between which potential difference is to be
measured. Before connecting a voltmeter, it should be
assured that its resistance is very high in comparison with the
resistance of the circuit across which it is connected
otherwise it will load the circuit and will alter the potential
difference which is required to be measured.
Example 14.6: What shunt resistance must be connected
across a galvanometer of 50.0 a resistance which gives full
scale deflection with 2.0 mA current, so as to convert it into an
ammeter of range 10.0A?

Solution:

Ohmmeter
It is a useful device for rapid measurement of resistance. It
consists of a galvanometer, and adjustable resistance r and
a cell connected in series (Fig.14.21-a). The series
resistance r is so adjusted that when terminals C and d are
short circuited, i.e., when R=0, the galvanometer gives full
scale deflection. So the extreme graduation of the usual
scale of the galvanometer is marked 0 for resistance
measurement. When terminals C and d are not joined, no
current passes through the galvanometer and its deflection is
zero. Thus zero of the scale is marked as infinity
(Fig. 14.21-b). Now a known resistance R is connected

across the terminals C and d. The galvanometer deflects to
some intermediate point. This point is calibrated as R. In this

way the whole scale is calibrated into resistance. The
resistance to be measured is connected across the terminals

C and d. The deflection on the calibrated scale reads the
value of the resistance directly.

SUMMARY
A magnetic field is set up in the region surrounding a current carrying conductor.
The right hand rule states, "If the wire is grasped in the fist of right hand with the
thumb pointing in the direction of current, the fingers of the hand will circle the wire in
the direction of the magnetic field".
The strength of the magnetic field or magnetic induction is the force acting on one
metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the magnetic field when 1 A
current is passing through it.
A magnetic field is said to have a strength of one tesla if it exerts a force of one
newton on one metre length of the conductor placed at right angle to the field when a
current of one ampere passes through the conductor.
The magnetic flux QB through plane element of area A in a uniform magnetic field B
is given by dot product of B and A.
Ampere circuital law states the sum of the quantities B. AL for all path elements into
which the complete loop has been divided equals P times the total current enclosed
by the loop.
The force experienced by a single charge carrier moving with velocity V in magnetic
field of strength B is F=q(vxB).
Cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is a high speed graph plotting device. It works by
deflecting beam of electrons as they pass through uniform electric field between the
two sets of parallel plates.
A torque may act on a current carrying coil placed in a magnetic field.

A galvanometer is an electric device which detects the flow of current. It usually
consists of a coil placed in a magnetic field. As the current passes through the coil,
the coil rotates, thus indicating the flow of current.
