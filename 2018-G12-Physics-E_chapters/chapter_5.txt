W
e have read in the last chapter that an A.C. generator produces alternating
voltage/current. Now a days most of the electrical energy is produced by A.C. generators
using water power or huge steam turbines. The main reason for the world wide use of A.C. is
that it can be transmitted to long distances easily and at a very low cost.
16.1 ALTERNATING CURRENT
Alternating current (A.C.) is that which is produced by a voltage source whose polarity keeps
on reversing with time (Fig. 16.1 a,b). In Fig. 16.1 (a), the terminal A of the source is positive
with respect to terminal B and it remains so during a time interval 0 to T/2. At t = T/2, the
terminals change their polarity. Now A becomes negative with respect to B (Fig.16.1 b). This
state continues during the time interval T/2 to T. after which terminal A again becomes
positive with respect to B and the next cycle starts. As a result of this change of polarity, the
direction of the current flow in the circuit also changes. During the time 0 - T/2, it flows in one
direction and during the interval T/2-Tin opposite direction (Fig. 16.1 a,b). This time interval T
111

during which the voltage source changes its polarity once is
known as period T of the alternating current or voltage. Thus
the frequency of alternating current or voltage is given as

Instantaneous value

The value of voltage or current that exists in a circuit at any
instant of time t measured from some reference point is
known as its instantaneous value. It can have any value

Fig. 16.2 is actually a set of all the instantaneous values that
exist during a period T. Mathematically, it is given by
V=Vo sin 0 = Vo sin wt
V = V6 sin 2nxt = Vo sin 2rft
(16.3)
2 Peak value
It is the maximum value reached by the voltage or current in
one cycle. For example, voltage shown in Fig. 16.2 has a
peak value of Vo.
3. Peak to Peak Value
It is the sum of the positive and negative peak values usually
written as p-p value. The p-p value of the voltage waveform
shown in Fig. 16.2 is 2V.

Let us compute the average value of V2 over a cycle. Fig. 16.3

Similarly
Most of the alternating current and voltage meters are
calibrated to read rms values. When we speak of A.C. meter
reading, we usually mean rms values unless stated
otherwise.
Example 16.1 : An A.C. voltmeter reads 250 V. What is its
peak and instantaneous values if the frequency of alternating
voltage is 50 Hz?
Solution:
rms value of alternating voltage = Vma=250V
Its peak value Vo is given by the relation
v-=
= = 353.5 V
or
Angular frequency (1) =2rf
=2xxx50 Hz = 100 T Hz
Therefore, instantaneous value is given by
V=V.sin.cot
= 353.5 sin (100 mt) V
Phase of A.C.
We have seen that the instantaneous value of the alternating
voltage is given by
V=V,sin of
or
V=Vsin0
This angle 0 which specifies the instantaneous value of the
alternating voltage or current is known as its phase. In
Fig.16.2(b), we can say that the phase at the points A, B, C, D
and E is 0, TO / 2, It, 3rd / 2 and 2 respectively because these
angles are the values of 0 at these points. Thus each point on
the A.C. waveform corresponds to a certain phase.
114
---

The phase at the positive peak is 2 = 90° and it is
3/2 = 270° at the negative peak. The points where the
waveform crosses the time axis correspond to phase 0 and TT.

Fig. 16.4 shows two waveforms 1 and 2. The phase angles of
the waveform 1 at the points A, B, C. D and E have been shown
Fig. 16.4
above the axis and those of waveform 2 below the axis. At the
point B, the phase of 1 is n 2 and that of 2 is 0. Similarly it can
be seen that at each point the phase of waveform 2 is less than
the phase of waveform 1 by an angle of It / 2. We say that A.C.2
is lagging behind A.C. 1 by an angle of II / 2. It means that at
each instant, the phase of A.C. 2 is less than the phase of A.C. 1

the phase of A.C. 2 is greater than that of 1 by TO 2.

Phase lead and lag between two alternating quantities is
conveniently shown by representing the two A.C. quantities
as vectors.

alternating quantities. Fig. 16.6 (b) shows the position of
voltage and current vector at t ==0.
16.2 A.C. CIRCUITS
The basic circuit element in a D.C. circuit is a resistor (R)
which controls the current or voltage and the relationship
between them is given by Ohm's law that is V=IR.
In A.C. circuits, in addition to resistor R, two new circuit
elements namely INDUCTOR (L), and CAPACITOR (C)
become relevant. The current and voltages in A.C. circuits
are controlled by three elements R, L and C. We would study
the response of an A.C. circuit when it is excited by an
A
alternating voltage.
16.3 A.C. THROUGH A RESISTOR

Fig. 16.7 (a) shows a resistor of resistance R connected with
an alternating voltage source.

At any time t the potential difference across the terminals of
the resistor is given by

where i is the instantaneous current and 10= = is the
peak value of the current. It follows from Eqs. 16.5 and 16.6
that the instantaneous values of both voltage and current are
(b)
sine functions which vary with time (Fig.16.7b). This figure
shows that when voltage rises, the current also rises. If the
voltage falls, the current also does so - both pass their
V
maximum and minimum values at the same instant. Thus in
a
purely resistive A.C. circuit, instantaneous values of voltage
I
and current are in phase. This behaviour is shown graphically
(c)
in Fig. 16.7 (b) and vectorially in Fig. 16.7 (c).
Fig. 16.7
Fig. 16.7 (c) shows V and I vectors for resistance. They are
drawn parallel because there is no phase difference between
them. The opposition to A.C. which the circuit
116
---

presents is the resistance
R=V/L
(16.7)
The instantaneous power in the resistance is given by
P=1'R=VI=V2/R
(16.8)
P is in watts, V is in volts, I is in amperes and R is in ohms. It is
very important to note that the Eq. 16.8 holds only when the
current and voltage are in phase.
16.4 A.C. THROUGH A CAPACITOR
V
C
Alternating current can flow through a resistor, but it is not
obvious that how it can flow through a capacitor. This can be
S
demonstrated by the circuit shown in Fig. 16.8. A low power
bulb is connected in series with a 1 uF capacitor to supply
Fig. 16.8
mains through a switch. When the switch is closed, the bulb
lights up showing that the current is flowing through the
capacitor. Direct current cannot flow through a capacitor
continuously because of the presence of an insulating
medium between the plates of the capacitor. Now let us see

how does A.C. flows through a capacitor. The current flows

applied alternating voltage, the charge on the capacitor at
any instant will be given by

Since C, V. are constants, it is obvious that q will vary the same
way as applied voltage i.e., Vand q are in phase (Fig. 16.9b).

the q - t curve. At o when q = 0, the slope is maximum, so /is

then a maximum. From o to A, slope of the q-t curve
decreases to zero. So / is zero at N. From A to B the slope of
Fig. 16.9
the q - t curve is negative and so I is negative from N to R. In
this way the curve PNRST gives the variation of current
with time.
117

Referring to the Fig. 16.2(b) it can be seen that the phase at o
is zero and the phase at the upper maximum is TL / 2. So in
Fig.16.9(b) the phase of V at o is zero but the current at this
point is maximum so its phase is TO / 2. Thus, the current is
leading the applied voltage by 90° or r/2. Now consider the
points A and N. The phase of alternating voltage at A is It / 2
but the phase of current at N is T. Again the current is leading
the voltage by 90° or It /2. Similarly by comparing the phase
at the pair of points (B, R), (C, S) and (D, T) it can be seen that
I
at all these-points the current leads the voltage by 90° or /2.
This is vectorially represented in Fig.16.9(c).

Reactance of a capacitor is a measure of the opposition
offered by the capacitor to the flow of A.C. It is usually
(c)
represented by Xc. Its value is given by
Fig 16.9
Xc=V/LL
(16.10)
where VITNE is the rms value of the alternating voltage across the
capacitor and I is the rms value of current passing through the
capacitor. The unit of reactance is ohm. In case of capacitor
1
(16.11)
According to Eq. 16.11, a certain capacitor will have a large
reactance at low frequency. So the magnitude of the
opposition offered by it will be large and the current in the
circuit will be small. On the other hand at high frequency, the
reactance will be low and the high frequency current through
the same capacitor will be large.

alternating voltage of 24 V and frequency 50 Hz. Calculate

16.5 A.C. THROUGH AN INDUCTOR
An inductor is usually in the form of a coil or a solenoid wound
from a thick wire so that it has a large value of self inductance
and has a negligible resistance. We have already seen how
self inductance opposes changes of current. So when an
alternating source of voltage is applied across an inductor, it
must oppose the flow of A.C. which is continuously changing
(Fig. 16.10). Let us assume that the resistance of the coil is
/ =1,sinut
negligible. We can simplify the theory by considering first, the
current and then finding the potential difference across the
inductor which will cause this current. Suppose the current is
/ = Io sin 2 Rf t. If L is the inductance of the coil, the changing
current sets up a back emf in the coil of magnitude
(a)
=LAF
To maintain the current, the applied voltage must be equal to
the back e.m.f. The applied voltage across the coil must,
therefore, be equal to

shows how the current I varies with time. The value of
(b)
Al / At is given by the slope of the I - t curve at the various
instants of time. At O, the value of the slope is maximum, so the
maximum value of Vequal to Vo occurs at o and is represented
by OP (Fig. 16.10 b). From o to A the slope of I - t graph
decreases to zero so the voltage decreases form Vo to zero at
Q. From A to B, the slope of the I - t graph is negative, so the
V
voltage curve goes from Q to R. In this way the voltage is
represented by the curve PQRST corresponding to current
(c)
curve OABCD. By comparing the phases of the pair of points
(O, P), (A, Q), (B, R), (C, S) and (D, T), it can be seen that the

phase of the current is always less than the phase of voltage by

90° or r/2 i.e., current lags behind the applied voltage by 90°
or it/ 2 or the applied voltage leads the current by 90° or r/2.

This is vectorially shown in Fig. 16.10(c) Inductive reactance
is a measure of the opposition offered by the inductance coil
to the flow of A.C. It is usually denoted by XL.

(16.12)
If Vrms rms is rms value of the alternating voltage across an
inductance and 1 mms the rms value of the current passing
through it, the value of X-Subscript(L) is given by
Interesting Information
(16.13)
The reactance of a coil, therefore, depends upon the
frequency of the A.C. and the inductance L. It is directly
proportional to both and L. is expressed in henry, fin hertz,
and X- in ohms. It is to be noted that inductance and
capacitance behave oppositely as a function of frequency. If f
is low X is small but X is large. For high f, X-Subscript(L) is large but X is
small. The behaviour of resistance is independent of
frequency.
Referring to Fig. 16.10 (b), it can be seen that no power is
dissipated in a pure inductor. In the first quarter of cycle both V
and I are positive so the power is positive, which means
energy is supplied to inductor. In the second quarter, V is
positive but I is negative. Now power is negative which implies
that energy is returned by the inductor. Again in third quarter, it
receives energy but returns the same amount in the fourth
Inductors are made in many sizes to
perform a wide variety of functions in
quarter. Thus. there is no net change of energy in a complete
business and industry.
cycle. Since an inductor coil does not consume energy, the
coil is often employed for controlling A.C. without consumption
of energy. Such an inductance coil is known as choke.
16.6 IMPEDANCE
We already know that resistance R offers opposition to the
flow of current. In case of A.C. an inductance L or a
capacitance C also offer opposition to the flow of A.C. which
is measured by reactances X1 and X respectively. An A.C.
circuit may consist of a resistance R, an inductance L.
a
capacitance C or a combination of these elements. The
combined effect of resistance and reactances in such a
circuit is known as impedance and is denoted by Z.
It is measured by the ratio of the rms value of the applied
voltage to the rms value of resulting A.C. Thus
Z 1/1 =

It is also expressed in ohms.

current flowing in it is 100 mA. Find its impedance.

16.7 R-C AND R-L SERIES CIRCUITS
Consider a series network of resistance R and a capacitor C
excited by an alternating voltage (Fig. 16.11 a). As R and C
are in series, the same current would flow through each of
them. If I m m is the value of current, the potential difference
across the resistance R would be I R and it would be

In Fig.16.11(c), the current is leading the voltage applied by

Now we will calculate the impedance of a R - L series circuit
by drawing its impedance diagram. 1.16.12 (a) shows an
V
R-L series circuit excited by an A.C. source of frequency 00.
The current is taken as reference, so it is represented by a
R
horizontal line. Resistance R is drawn along this line because
the potential drop I mm R is in phase with current. As the
potential across the inductance VL = Irma X-Subscript(1) = I (wL) leads

the current by 90°, so the vector line of reactance X- = oL is
drawn at right angle to R line (Fig. 16.12b). The impedance Z

Thus

The expression for power is P = rms This expression is true
in case of A.C. circuits, only when V and I are in phase as in

case of a purely resistive circuit. We have already seen that the
power dissipation in a pure inductive or in a pure capacitance
circuit is zero. In these cases the current lags or leads the
applied voltage by 90° and component of applied voltage
vector V along the current vector is zero (Fig. 16.9 C and
16.10 c). In A.C. circuit the phase difference between applied
voltage V and the current is 0 (Fig. 16.11 b and 16.12 b). The
component of V along current I is Vima cosO. Actually it is this
component of voltage vector which is in phase with current. So

16.11 THREE PHASE A.C. SUPPLY
We have already studied that an A.C. generator consists of a
coil with a pair of slip rings. As the coil rotates an alternating
voltage is generated across the slip rings. In a three phase
A.C. generator, instead of one coil, there are three coils
inclined at 120° to each other, each connected to its own pair
of slip rings. When this combination of three coils rotate in the
magnetic field, each coil generates an alternating voltage
across its own pair of slip rings. Thus, three alternating
voltages are generated. The phase difference between these
voltages is 120°. It means that when voltage across the first
126
---

pair of slip rings is zero, having a phase of 0, the voltage
across the second pair of slip rings would not be zero but it
will have a phase of 120°. Similarly at this instant the voltage
generated across the third pair will have a phase 240°. This is
shown in Fig. 16.17. The machine, instead of having six
PHASE PHASE 2 PHASE 3
terminals, two for each pair of slip rings, has only four
terminals because the starting point of all the three coils has a
common junction which is often earthed to the shaft of the
generator and the other three ends of the coils are connected
to three separate terminals on the machine. These four
terminals along with the lines and coils connected to them are
Fig. 16.17
shown in Fig. 16.18. The voltage across each of lines
connected to terminals A, B, C and the neutral line is 230 V.
Because of 120° phase shift, the voltage across any two lines
A
is about 400 V. The main advantage of having a three phase
supply is that the total load of the house or a factory is divided
in three parts, so that none of the line is over loaded. If heavy

load consisting of a number of air conditioners and motors

etc., is supplied power from a single phase supply, its voltage
230V
is likely to drop at full load. Moreover, the three phase supply
also provides 400 V which can be used to operate some
special appliances requiring 400 V for their operation.

16.12 PRINCIPLE OF METAL DETECTORS
A coil and a capacitor are electrical components which
together can produce oscillations of current. An L - C circuit
behaves just like an oscillating mass - spring system. In this
case energy oscillates between a capacitor and an inductor.
The circuit is called an electrical oscillator. Two such
oscillators A and B are used in the operation of a common
type of metal detector (Fig.16.19). In the absence of any
nearby

metal object, the inductances LA and LB are the same and
hence the resonance frequency of the two circuits is also
same. When the inductor B, called the search coil comes
near a metal object, its inductance LB decreases and
corresponding oscillator frequency increases and thus a
beat note is heard in the attached speaker. Such detectors
are extensively used not only for various security checks but
also to locate buried metal objects.
16.13 CHOKE
It is a coil which consists of thick copper wire wound closely in
a large number of turns over a soft iron laminated cores. This
makes the inductance L of the coil quite large whereas its
resistance R is very small. Thus it consumes extremely small
power. It is used in A.C. circuits to limit current with extremely
small wastage of energy as compared to a resistance or a
rheostat.

16.14 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
A
C
It is a very important class of waves which requires no
medium for transmission and which rapidly propagates
through vacuum.
In 1864 British physicist James Clark Maxwell formulated a
set of equations known as Maxwell's equations which
explained the various electromagnetic phenomena.
According to these equations, a changing magnetic flux
B
creates an electric field and a changing electric flux creates a
magnetic field. Consider a region of space AB as shown in
Fig 16.20
Fig.16.20. Suppose a change of magnetic flux is taking place
through it. This changing magnetic flux will set up a changing
electric flux in the surrounding region. The creation of electric
field in the region CD will cause a change of electric flux
through it due to which a magnetic field would be set up in the
space surrounding CD and so on. Thus each field generates
the other and the whole package of electric and magnetic
fields will move along propelling itself through space. Such
moving electric and magnetic fields are known as
electromagnetic waves. The electric field, magnetic field and
the direction of their propagation are mutually orthogonal
(Fig.16.21). It can be seen in this figure that the
electromagnetic waves are periodic, hence they have a
wavelength a which is given by the relation C = fh where fis

the speed of electromagnetic waves is 3 X 108 ms

16.15 PRINCIPLE OF GENERATION,
TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION
OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
We have seen that electromagnetic waves are generated
when electric or magnetic flux is changing through a certain
region of space. An electric charge at rest gives rise to a
Coulomb's field which does not radiate in space because no
change of flux takes place in this type of field. A charge
moving with constant velocity is equivalent to a steady

object to and fro, and you produce
current which generates a constant magnetic field in the

surrounding space, but such a field also does not radiate out
because no changes of magnetic flux are involved. Thus only
Transmitting
antenna
chance to generate a wave of moving field is when we
accelerate the electrical charges.
A radio transmitting antenna provides a good example of
generating electromagnetic waves by acceleration of
charges. The piece of wire along which charges are made to
accelerate is known as transmitting antenna (Fig.16.23). It is
charged by an alternating source of potential of frequency f
and time period T. As the charging potential alternates, the
Fig. 16.23
charge on the antenna also constantly reverses. For
example if the top has + q charges at any instant, then after
time T/2 the charge on it will be - q. Such regular reversal of
Do You Know?
charges on the antenna gives rise to an electric flux that
constantly changes with frequency f. This changing electric
flux sets up an electromagnetic wave which propagates out
in space away from the antenna. The frequency with which
the fields alternate is always equal to the frequency of the
source generating them. These electromagnetic waves
which are propagated out in space from antenna of a
transmitter are known as radio waves. In free space these
waves travel with the speed of light.
Suppose these waves impinge on a piece of wire (Fig. 16.24).
The electrons in the wire move under the action of the

same as that of the wave intercepting the wire. This wire
receiving the wave is known as receiving antenna. As the
electric field of the wave is very weak at a distance of many
kilometres from the transmitter, the voltage that appears
across the receiving antenna is very small. Each transmitter
11/11/19
propagates radio waves of one particular frequency. So
when a number of transmitting stations operate
simultaneously, we have a number of radio waves of different
frequencies in the space. Thus the voltage that appears
across a receiving antenna placed in space is usually due to
the radio waves of large number of frequencies, The voltage
of one particular frequency can be picked up by connecting
an inductance L and a variable capacitor C in parallel with
one end of the receiving antenna (Fig. 16.24).
If one adjusts the value of the capacitor so that the natural
Flg. 16.24
frequency of L - C circuit is the same as that of the
transmitting station to be picked up, the circuit will resonate

under the driving action of the antenna. Consequently, the
L - C circuit will build up a large response to the action of only
that radio wave to which it is tuned. In your radio receiver set
when you change stations you actually adjust the value of C.

The F.M. transmission frequencies are much higher and ranges
between 88 MHz to 108 MHz. F.M. radio waves are affected
less by electrical interference than A.M. radio waves and hence,
provide a higher quality transmission of sound. However, they
have a shorter range than A.M. waves and are less able to
travel around obstacles such as hills and large buildings.
SUMMARY
Alternating current is that which is produced by a voltage source whose polarity
keeps on reversing with time.
The time interval during which the voltage source changes its polarity. once is known
as period T of the alternating current or voltage.
The value of voltage or current that exists in a circuit at any instant of time measured
from some reference point is known as its instantaneous value.
The highest value reached by the voltage or current in one cycle is called the peak
value of the voltage or current.
The sum of positive and negative peak values is called peak to peak value and is
written as p-p value.
The root mean square value (rms) is the square root of the average value of V
The angle 0 which specifies the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage or
current, gives the phase lag or phase lead of one quantity over the other.
An inductor is usually in the form of a coil or a solenoid wound from a thick wire so
that it has a large value of self inductance and has negligible resistance.
The combined effect of resistance and reactance in a circuit is known as impedance
and is denoted by Z.
Choke is a coil which consists of thick copper wire wound closely in a large number
of turns over a soft iron laminated core.
Electromagnetic waves are those which require no medium for transmission and
rapidly propagate through vacuum.
Modulation is the process of combining the low frequency signal with a high
frequency radio wave, called carrier waves. The resultant wave is called modulated
carrier wave.
