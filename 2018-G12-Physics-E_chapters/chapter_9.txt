T
he branch of physics that deals with the investigation of wavelengths and intensities of
electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by atoms is called spectroscopy. It includes
the study of spectra produced by atoms. In general there are three types of spectra called (i)
continuous spectra, (ii) band spectra, and (iii) discrete or line spectra.
Black body radiation spectrum, as described in chapter 19 is an example of continuous
spectra; molecular spectra are the examples of band spectra while the atomic spectra,
which we shall investigate in detail in this chapter, are examples of discrete or line spectra.
20.1 ATOMIC SPECTRA
When an atomic gas or vapour at much less than atmospheric pressure is suitably excited,
usually by passing an electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a spectrum, which
contains certain specific wavelengths only. An idealized arrangement for observing such
atomic spectra is shown in Fig. 20. 1. Actual spectrometer uses diffraction grating for better
results.
The impression on the screen is in the form of lines if the slit in front of the source S is narrow
rectangle. It is for this reason that the spectrum is referred to as line spectrum.
The fact that the spectrum of any element contains wavelengths that exhibit definite
regularities was utilized in the second half of the 19th century in identifying different elements.

These regularities were classified into certain groups called
the spectral series. The first such series was identified by J.J
Balmer in 1885 in the spectrum of hydrogen. This series,
called the Balmer series, is shown in Fig.20.2, and is in the
visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The results obtained by Balmer were expressed in 1896 by

together with similar regularities in the spectra of more
complex elements, proposes a definite test for any theory of
atomic structure.
20.2 BOHR'S MODEL OF THE HYDROGEN
ATOM
In order to explain the empirical results obtained by Rydberg,
Neils Bohr, in 1913, formulated a model of hydrogen atom
utilizing classical physics and Planck's quantum theory. This
semi classical theory is based on the following three
postulates:
Postulate I: An electron, bound to the nucleus in an atom,
can move around the nucleus in certain circular orbits without
radiating. These orbits are called the discrete stationary
states of the atom.

and n is called the principal quantum
number, m and V are the mass and velocity of the orbiting
electron respectively, and h is Planck's constant.

Postulate III: Whenever an electron makes a transition,
that is, jumps from high energy state E to a lower energy
state E, a photon of energy h fis emitted so that
hf=E.-E,
(20.7)
where f= c/n is the frequency of the radiation emitted.

which is the energy required to completely remove an electron
from the first Bohr orbit. This is called ionization energy. The
ionization energy may be provided to the electron by collision
with an external electron. The minimum potential through
which this external electron should be accelerated so that it
can supply the requisite ionization energy is known as
ionization potential. Thus for n = 1, 2, 3 we get
the
allowed energy levels of a hydrogen atom to be
The experimentally measured value of the binding energy of
the electron in the hydrogen atom is in perfect agreement
with the value predicted by Bohr theory.
Normally the electron in the hydrogen atom is in the lowest
energy state corresponding to n = 1 and this state is called
the ground state or normal state. When it is in higher orbit, it is
said to be in the excited state. The atom may be exited by
collision with externally accelerated electron. The potential
through which an electron should be accelerated so that, on
collision it can lift the electron in the atom from its ground
state to some higher state, is known as excitation potential.

from their normal energy levels. After excitation, when an
atom returns to its normal state, photons of larger energy are
emitted. Thus transition of inner shell electrons in heavy
atoms gives rise to the emission of high energy photons or X-
rays. These X-rays consist of series of specific wavelengths
or frequencies and hence are called characteristic X-rays.

with which the electron strike the target is given by
K.E. = Ve
(20.19)
Suppose that these fast moving electrons of energy Ve strike
a target made of tungsten or any other heavy element. It is
possible that in collision, the electrons in the innermost
shells, such as K or L, will be knocked out. Suppose that one
of the electrons in the K shell is removed, thereby producing
a vacancy or hole in that shell. The electron from the L shell

jumps to occupy the hole in the K shell, thereby emitting a
photon of energy h for called the K.X-ray given by
hf_=E-Ex
(20.20)
It is also possible that the electron from the M shell might also
jump to occupy the hole in the K shell. The photons emitted
are Kg X-ray with energies
hfu=Em-E
(20.21)
these photons give rise to Kg X-ray and so on.
The photons emitted in such transitions i.e., inner shell
transitions are called characteristic X-rays, because their
energies depend upon the type of target material.
The holes created in the L and M shells are occupied by
transitions of electrons from higher states creating more
X-rays. The characteristic X-rays appear as discrete lines on

Wavelength (nm)
The Continuous X-ray Spectrum
Fig. 20.6
The continuous spectrum is due to an effect known as
bremsstrahlung or braking radiation When the fast moving
electrons bombard the target, they are suddenly slowed
down on impact with the target. We know that an accelerating
charge emits electromagnetic radiation. Hence, these
impacting electrons emit radiation as they are strongly
decelerated by the target. Since the rate of deceleration is so
large, the emitted radiation correspond to short wavelength
and so the bremsstrahlung is in the X-ray region. In the case
when the electrons lose all their kinetic energy in the first
collision, the entire kinetic energy appears as a X-ray photon
of energy hf mart i.e.,
K.E.=him
The wavelength 2. in Fig. 20.8 corresponds to frequency
finds Other electrons do not lose all their energy in the first
collision. They may suffer a number of collisions before
coming to rest. This will give rise to photons of smaller energy
or X-rays of longer wavelength. Thus the continuous
spectrum is obtained due to deceleration of impacting
electrons.
Properties and Uses of X-rays
X-rays have many practical applications in medicine and
industry. Because X-rays can penetrate several centimetres
210

into a solid matter, so they can be used to visualize the
interiors of the materials opaque to ordinary light, such as
For Your Information
fractured bones or defects in structural steel. The object to be
visualized is placed between an X-ray source and a large
sheet of photographic film; the darkening of the film is
proportional to the radiation exposure. A crack or air bubble
allows greater amount of X-rays to pass. This appears as a
dark area on the photographic film. Shadow of bones
appears lighter than the surrounding flesh. It is due to the fact
that bones contain greater proportions of elements with high
atomic number and so they absorb greater amount of
incident X-rays than flesh. In flesh, light elements like carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen predominate. These elements allow
greater amount of incident X-rays to pass through them.
CAT - Scanner
In the recent past, several vastly improved X-ray techniques
have been developed. One widely used system is

instrument is called CAT-Scanner. The X-ray source
produces a thin fan-shaped beam that is detected on the
opposite side of the subject by an array of several hundred
detectors in a line. Each detector measures absorption of

X-ray along a thin line through the subject. The entire
apparatus is rotated around the subject in the plane of the
beam during a few seconds. The changing reactions of the
detector are recorded digitally; a computer processes this
information and reconstructs a picture of different densities
over an entire cross section of the subject. Density
differences of the order of one percent can be detected with
CAT-Scans. Tumors, and other anomalies much too small to
be seen with older techniques can be detected.

absorbed in tissues, they break molecular bonds and create
highly reactive free radicals (such as H and OH), which in
turn can disturb the molecular structure of the proteins and
especially the genetic material. Young and rapidly growing
cells are particularly susceptible; hence
X-rays are useful for selective destruction of cancer cells. On
the other hand a cell may be damaged by radiation but
survive, continue dividing and produce generation of
defective cells. Thus X-rays can cause cancer. Even when

20.4 UNCERTAINTY WITHIN THE ATOM
One of the characteristics of dual nature of matter is a
fundamental limitation in the accuracy of the simultaneous
measurement of the position and momentum of a particle.
(a)
Heisenberg showed that this is given by the equation
Ap AX2
2
However, these limitations are significant in the realm of
atom. One interesting question is whether electrons are
present in atomic nuclei. As the typical nuclei are loss than
10-14 m in diameter, for an electron to be confined within such a

nucleus, the uncertainty in its position is of the order of 10-14 m.

6.63x10-20 kgms-1
Hence
Av=

Hence, for the electron to be confined to a nucleus, its speed
would have to be greater than 1010 ms i.e., greater than the
speed of light. Because this is impossible, we must conclude
that an electron can never be found inside of a nucleus. But
can an electron reside inside the atom? To find this, we again
calculate the speed of an electron and if it turns to be less
than the speed of light, we have reasonable expectation of
finding the electron within the atom but outside the nucleus.
The radius of the hydrogen atom is about 5x 10-11 m. Applying
the uncertainty principle to the momentum of electron in the
atom we have

Thus

This speed of the electron is less than the speed of light,
therefore, it can exist in the atom but outside the nucleus.
20.5 LASER
Laser is the acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated
Emission of Radiation. As the name indicates, lasers are
used for producing an intense, monochromatic, and
unidirectional coherent beam of visible light. To understand
the working of a laser, terms such as stimulated emission and
population inversion must be understood.
Spontaneous and Stimulated Emissions
Consider a sample of free atoms some of which are in the
ground state with energy E, and some in the excited state E2
as shown in Fig. 20.9. The photons of energy hf = E2 - E, are
incident on this sample. These incident photons can interact

with atoms in two different ways. In Fig. 20.9 (a) the incident

direction thus we have accomplished two things; an amplified
as well as a unidirectional coherent beam. From a practical
point this is possible only if there is more stimulated or
induced emission than spontaneous emission. This can be
achieved as described in the next section.

Once the population inversion has been reached, the lasing
action of a laser is simple to achieve. The atoms in the
metastable state E2 are bombarded by photons of energy
hf = E2 - E1, resulting in an induced emission, giving an
intense, coherent beam in the direction of the incident
photon.

enough to stimulate further emission from other excited
atoms. This is achieved by using mirrors at the two ends of

laboratories. Its discharge tube is filled with 85% helium and
15% neon gas. The neon is the lasing or active medium in this
tube. By chance, helium and neon have nearly identical
metastable states, respectively located 20.61 eV and
20.66 eV level. The high voltage electric discharge excites
the electrons in some of the helium atoms to the 20.61 eV
state. In this laser, population inversion in neon is achieved
by direct collisions with same energy electrons of helium
atoms. Thus excited helium atoms collide with neon atoms,

SUMMARY
When an atomic gas or vapours at less than atmospheric pressure is suitably
excited, usually by passing electric current through it, the emitted radiation has a
spectrum which contains certain specific wavelenghts only.
Postulates of Bohr's model of hydrogen atom are:
An electron, bound to the nucleus in an atom, can move around the nucleus in
certain circular orbits without radiating. These orbits are called the discrete
stationary states of the atom.
II.
Only those stationary states are allowed for which orbital angular momentum is
equal to an integral multiple of hi.e., mvr=nh
III.
Whenever an electron makes a transition, i.e., jumps from high energy state E, to
a
lower energy state E a photon of energy h fis emitted so that hf=E.-E. -
The transition of electrons in the hydrogen or other light elements result in the
emission of spectral lines in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet region of
electromagnetic spectrum due to small energy differences in the transition levels.
The X-rays emitted in inner shell transitions are called characteristic X-rays,
because their energy depends upon the type of target material.
The X-rays that are emitted in all directions and with a continuous range of
frequencies are known as continuous X-rays.
Laser is the acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.

The incident photon absorbed by an atom in the ground state E, thereby leaving
the atom in the excited state E2 is called stimulated or induced absorption.
Spontaneous or induced emission is that in which the atom emits a photon of energy
hf=E2 - E, in any arbitrary direction.
Stimulated or induced emission is that in which the incident photon of energy hf=E2-E,
induces the atom to decay by emitting a photon that travels in the direction of the
incident photon. For each incident photon, we will have two photons going in the same
direction giving rise to an amplified as well as a unidirectional coherent beam.
