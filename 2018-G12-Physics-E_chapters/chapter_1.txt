he study of electric charges at rest under the action of electric forces is known as
electrostatics. An electric force is the force which holds the positive and negative charges
that make up atoms and molecules. The human body is composed entirely of atoms and
molecules, thus we owe our existence to the electric force.

12.1 COULOMB'S LAW
We know that there are two kinds of charges, namely,
positive and negative charges. The charge on an electron is
assumed to be negative and charge on a proton is positive.
Moreover, we also learnt that like charges repel each other
and unlike charges attract each other. Now we investigate
the quantitative nature of these forces. The first
measurement of the force between electric charges was
made in 1874 AD by Charles Coulomb, a French military
engineer. On the basis of these measurements, he deduced
a law known as Coulomb's law. It states that

The force between two point charges is directly proportional
to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them.

12.2 FIELDS OF FORCE
Newton's universal gravitational law and Coulomb's law
enable us to calculate the magnitude as well as the directions
of the gravitational and electric forces, respectively. However
one may question, (a) What are the origins of these forces?
(b) How are these forces transmitted from one mass to
another or from one charge to another?
The answer to (a) is still unknown; the existence of these
forces is accepted as it is. That is why they are called basic
forces of nature.
To describe the mechanism by which electric force is
transmitted, Michael Faraday (1791-1867) introduced the
concept of an electric field. According to his theory, it is the
intrinsic property of nature that an electric field exists in the
space around an electric charge. This electric field is
considered to be a force field that exerts a force on other
charges placed in that field. For example, a charge q
produces an electric field in the space surrounding it. This
4
---

field exists whether the other charges are present in space or
not. However, the presence of field cannot be tested until
another charge q. is brought into the field. Thus the field of
charge q interacts with qo to produce an electrical force. The
interaction between q and q. is accomplished in two steps:
(a) the charge q produces a field and (b) the field interacts
with charge q. to produce a force F on 9. These two steps are
illustrated in Fig. 12.4.
In this figure the density of dots is proportional to the strength
of the field at the various points. We may define electric field
strength or electric field intensity E at any point in the field as

placed at the point. The test charge q. has to be very small so
F=q.E
that it may not distort the field which it has to measure.
Since electric field intensity is force per unit charge, it is
measured in newton per coulomb in SI units. It is a vector
quantity and its direction is the same as that of the force F.

12.3 ELECTRIC FIELD LINES
A visual representation of the electric field can be obtained in
terms of electric field lines; an idea proposed by Michael

charges each of magnitude q. at different places but at equal
distances from a positive charge +q as shown in the figure.
Each test charge will experience a repulsive force, as
indicated by arrows in Fig. 12.6(a). Therefore, the electric
field created by the charge +q is directed radially outward.
Fig. 12.6 (b) shows corresponding field lines which show the
field direction. Fig. 12.7 shows the electric field lines in the
vicinity of a negative charge -q. In this case the lines are
directed radially "inward", because the force on a positive
test charge is now of attraction, indicating the electric field
points inward.
Figures 12.6 and 12.7 represent two dimensional pictures of
the field lines. However, electric field lines emerge from the

The electric field lines "map" also provides information about

the strength of the electric field. As we notice in
Figs. 12.6 and 12.7 that field lines are closer to each other
near the charges where the field is strong while they
continuously spread out indicating a continuous decrease in
the field strength.
"The number of lines per unit area passing
perpendicularly through an area is proportional
to the magnitude of the electric field".
The electric field lines are curved in case of two identical
separated charges. Fig. 12.8 shows the pattern of lines

like charges seem to repel each other. The behaviour of two
identical negatively charges will be exactly the same. The
middle region shows the presence of a zero field spot or
neutral zone.
The Fig. 12.9 shows the electric field pattern of two opposite

charges of same magnitudes. The field lines start from
positive charge and end on a negative charge. The electric
field at points such as 1, 2, 3 is the resultant of fields created
by the two charges at these points. The directions of the
resultant intensities is given by the tangents drawn to the field
lines at these points.

therefore, field is uniform on all points. Fig.12.10 shows the
field lines between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. The
field is uniform in the middle region where field lines are
equally spaced.
We are now in a position to summarize the properties
of electric field lines.
1)
Electric field lines originate from positive charges
and end on negative charges.
2)
The tangent to a field line at any point gives the
direction of the electric field at that point.

process is called xerography, from the Greek word "xeros"
and "graphos", meaning "dry writing". The heart of machine
is a drum which is an aluminium cylinder coated with a layer
of selenium. Aluminium is an excellent conductor. On the
other hand, selenium is an insulator in the dark and becomes
a conductor when exposed to light; it is a photoconductor. As
a result, if a positive charge is sprinkled over the selenium it
will remain there as long as it remains in dark. If the drum is
exposed to light, the electrons from aluminium pass through
the conducting selenium and neutralize the positive charge.
If the drum is exposed to an image of the document to be

In this way, a positive charge image of the document remains
on the selenium surface. Then a special dry, black powder
called "toner" is given a negative charge and spread over the
drum, where it sticks to the positive charged areas.
The toner from the drum is transferred on to a sheet of paper

rollers then melt the toner into the paper which is also given
an excess positive charge to produce the permanent
impression of the document.

Inkjet Printers
An inkjet printer (Fig. 12.12 a) is a type of printer which uses
electric charge in its operation. While shuttling back and forth
across the paper, the inkjet printer "ejects" a thin stream of
ink. The ink is forced out of a small nozzle and breaks up into
extremely small droplets. During their flight, the droplets pass
through two electrical components, a "charging electrode"
and the "deflection plates" (a parallel plate capacitor). When
the printhead moves over regions of the paper which are not
to be inked, the charging electrode is left on and gives the ink
droplets a net charge. The deflection plates divert such
charged drops into a gutter and in this way such drops are not
able to reach the paper. Whenever ink is to be placed on the

the charging electrode. The uncharged droplets fly straight
through the deflection plates and strike the paper. Schematic

12.5 ELECTRIC FLUX
When we place an element of area in an electric field, some
of the lines of force pass through it (Fig. 12.13a a).
The number of the field lines passing through a certain element
of area is known as electric flux through that area. It is usually
denoted by Greek letter O. For example the flux 0 through the
area A in Fig. 12.13 (a) is 4 while the flux through B is 2.

between electric flux O. electric intensity E and area A we
consider the Fig. 12.13 (b,c,d) which shows the three
dimensional representation of the electric field lines due to a
uniform electric field of intensity E.

where A1 indicates that A is held parallel to the field lines.
Fig. 12.13 (d) shows the case when A is neither perpendicular

Usually the element of area is represented by a vector area A
whose magnitude is equal to the surface area A of the
Fig.12.13(d)
element and whose direction is direction of normal to the
area. The electric flux 0. through a patch of flat surface in
terms of E and A is then given by
EAcose=E.A
(12.12)
where 0 is the angle between the field lines and the normal to
the area.
Electric flux, being a scalar product, is a scalar quantity. Its SI
unit is Nm2
12.6 ELECTRIC FLUX THROUGH A
SURFACE ENCLOSING A CHARGE
Let us calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, in
shape of a sphere of radius r due to a point charge q

placed at the centre of sphere as shown in Fig. 12.14. To
E
apply the formula Q. = E.A for the computation of electric flux,
the surface area should be flat. For this reason the total

surface area of the sphere is divided into n small patches with
areas of magnitudes , , . If n is very large,
each patch would be a flat element of area. The
corresponding vector areas are , , , ,
respectively. The direction of each vector area is along

perpendicular drawn outward to the corresponding patch.
The electric intensities at the centres of vector areas

E respectively.
According to Eq.12.12, the total flux passing through the
closed surface is

The direction of electric intensity and vector area is same at

Now imagine that a closed surface S is enclosing this sphere.
It can be seen in Fig. 12.15 that the flux through the closed
surface S is the same as that through the sphere. So we can
conclude that total flux through a closed surface does not
depend upon the shape or geometry of the closed surface. It
depends upon the medium and the charge enclosed.

Gauss's law which can be stated as,
"The flux through any closed surface is
1/eg times the total charge enclosed in it".
12.8 APPLICATIONS OF GAUSS'S LAW
Gauss's law is applied to calculate the electric intensity due
to different charge configurations. In all such cases, an
imaginary closed surface is considered which passes
through the point at which the electric intensity is to be
evaluated. This closed surface is known as Gaussian
surface. Its choice is such that the flux through it can be easily
evaluated. Next the charge enclosed by Gaussian surface is
calculated and finally the electric intensity is computed by
applying Gauss's law Eq.12.16. We will illustrate this
procedure by considering some examples.

Thus the interior of a hollow charged metal sphere is a field

a metal enclosure is "shielded" from electric fields.

surface charge density is, say, o. A finite part of this sheet is
shown in Fig. 12.18. To calculate the electric intensity E at a
point P. close to the sheet, imagine a closed Gaussian
surface in the form of a cylinder passing through the sheet,
whose one flat face contains point P. From symmetry we can
conclude that E points at right angle to the end faces and
away from the plane. Since E is parallel to the curved surface
of the cylinder, so there is no contribution to flux from the

charges. Under these conditions the charges are essentially
concentrated on the inner surfaces of the plates. The field

form of sheet of charges of surface density o = q/A, where A
is the area of plate and q is the amount of charge on either of
the plates.
Imagine now, a Gaussian surface in the form of a hollow box
with its top inside the upper metal plate and its bottom in the
space between the plates as shown in Fig. 12.20. As the field
lines are parallel to the sides of the box, therefore, the flux
through the sides is zero. The field lines are uniformly
distributed on the lower bottom face and are directed

electric potential difference between the points A and B are
related as

Thus the potential difference between the two points can be
defined as the difference of the potential energy per unit

In order to give a concept of electric potential at a point in an
electric field, we must have a reference to which we assign
zero electric potential. This point is usually taken at infinity.

Electric Potential at a Point due to a Point

Let us derive an expression for the potential at a certain point in
the field of a positive point charge q. This can be accomplished
by bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point
keeping the charge in equilibrium. The target can be achieved
using Eq. 12.29 in the form AV = -E Ar. provided electric
intensity E remains constant. However in this case E varies

the electric potential at a point. The field is radial as shown in
Fig. 12.22.
Let us take two points A and B, infinitesimally close to each
other, so that E remains almost constant between them. The
distance of points A and B from q are r and respectively

Thus, in this case, the energy acquired by the charge will be

In chapter 4, we pointed out that gravitational force is a
conservative force, that is, work done in such a field is
independent of path. It can also be proved that Coulomb's
electrostatic force is also conservative force. The electric
force between two charges is similar in form to
the gravitational force between the two point masses,

distance between the two charges or the two masses.
However, the value of gravitational constant G is very small

currents. The separation between the plates is d. The upper
plate P has a small hole H, as shown in the figure. A voltage V
is applied to the plates due to which the electric field E is

In order to determine the mass m of the droplet, the electric
field between the plates is switched off. The droplet falls under the
action of gravity through air. It attains terminal speed V, almost at the
instant the electric field is switched off. Its terminal speed V1 is
determined by timing the fall of the droplet over a measured
distance. Since the drag force F due to air acting upon the droplet
when it is falling with constant terminal speed is equal to its weight.
Hence, using Stokes's law

Knowing the value of r, the mass m can be calculated by
using Eq. (12.45). This value of m is substituted in Eq. 12.44
to get the value of charge q on the droplet.
Millikan measured the charge on many drops and found that
each charge was an integral multiple of a minimum value of
charge equal to 1.6 X 10-19 C. He, therefore, concluded that this
minimum value of the charge is the charge on an electron.
Example 12.5: In Millikan oil drop experiment, an oil drop
of mass 4.9 x 10 15 kg is balanced and held stationary by the
electric field between two parallel plates. If the potential
difference between the plates is 750 V and the spacing
between them is 5.0 mm, calculate the charge on the droplet.

dielectric is due to electric polarization of dielectric.
The dielectric consists of atoms and molecules which are
electrically neutral on the average, i.e, they contain equal
amounts of negative and positive charges. The distribution of
these charges in the atoms and molecules is such that the
centre of the positive charge coincides with the centre of
negative charge. When the molecules of dielectric are
subjected to an electric field between the plates of a
capacitor, the negative charges (electrons) are attracted
towards the positively charged plate of the capacitor and the
positive charges (nuclei) towards the negatively charged
plate. The electrons in the dielectric (insulator) are not free to
move but it is possible that the electrons and nuclei can
undergo slight displacement when subjected to an electric
field. As a result of this displacement the centre of positive
and negative charges now no longer coincide with each other
and one end of molecules shows a negative charge and the
other end, an equal amount of positive charge but the
molecule as a whole is still neutral. Two equal and opposite
charges separated by a small distance are said to constitute
a dipole. Thus the molecules of the dielectric under the action
of electric field become dipoles and the dielectric is said to be
polarized.
The effect of the polarization of dielectric is shown in
24
---

Fig. 12.26. The positively charged plate attracts the negative
end of the molecular dipoles and the negatively charged plate
attracts the positive end. Thus the surface of the dielectric
which is in contact with the positively charged plate places a

layer of negative charges on the plate. Similarly the surface of

dielectric as demonstrated by the experiment described in the
previous section.
12.16 ENERGY STORED IN ACAPACITOR
A capacitor is a device to store charge. Alternatively, it is
possible to think of a capacitor as a device for storing
electrical energy. After all, the charge on the plate possesses
electrical potential energy which arises because work is to be
done to deposit charge on the plates. This is due to the fact
that with each small increment of charge being deposited
during the charging process, the potential difference
between the plates increases, and a larger amount of work is
needed to bring up next increment of charge.
Initially when the capacitor is uncharged, the potential
difference between plates is zero and finally it becomes V
when q charge is deposited on each plate. Thus, the average
potential difference is 0+V-1V +
2
2
Therefore
P.E.=Energy=1qv =
Using the relation q = CVfor capacitor we get
Energy = 1/2 CV2
(12.53)
It is also possible to regard the energy as being stored in
electric field between the plates, rather than the potential
energy of the charges on the plates. Such a view point is
useful when electric field strength between the plates instead
of charges on the plates causing field is to be considered.
This relation can be obtained by substituting V = Ed and

SUMMARY
The Coulomb's law states that the force between two point charges is directly
proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to
the square of the distance between them.
Electric field force per unit charge at a point is called electric field strength or electric
field intensity at that point.
The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as
electric flux through that area, denoted by O.
The electric flux 0 through a vector area A, in the electric field of intensity E is given by
0 = E.A = EA cos0 where 0 is the angle between the field lines and the normal to
surface area.
Gauss's law is stated as "the flux through any closed surface is 1/eg times the total
charge enclosed in it.
The interior of a hollow charged metal sphere is a field free region.
The electric intensity between two oppositely charged parallel plates is E=2
