T
he huge advances in electronics over the recent past are due to discovery and use of
semi-conductors. Silicon is one of the most commonly used semi-conductors, and is the
basic material from which highly sophisticated integrated circuits known as 'chips' are
made. The use of chips in analogue as well as in digital electronics is described in the form of
the black boxes. This chapter is based on the preliminary concepts introduced in the
secondary school physics course.
18.1 BRIEF REVIEW OF p-n JUNCTION AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS
Ap-n junction is formed when a crystal of germanium or silicon is grown in such a way that its
one half is doped with a trivalent impurity and the other half with a pentavalent impurity. One
of the most important building blocks of electronic devices is the p-n junction. Its n-region
contains free electrons as majority charge carriers and p-region contains holes as majority
charge carriers. Just after the formation of the junction, the free electrons in the in-region,
because of their random motion, diffuse into the p-region. As a result of this diffusion, a
région is formed around the junction in which charge carriers are not present This region is
known as depletion region (Fig. 18.1 a). In this figure, blue dots represent the free electrons
and the small circles show the holes whereas the circles with + and - signs show the
positive and negative ions which constitute the depletion region. Due to charge on

these ions a potential difference develops across the
depletion region (Fig. 18.1 b). Its value is 0.7 V in case of
silicon and 0.3 V in case of germanium. This potential
difference, called potential barrier, stops further diffusion of
electrons into the p-region.

Forward Biased p-n Junction
(a)
When an external potential difference is applied across a p-n
junction such that p-side is positive and n-side is negative,
then this external potential difference supplies energy to free
electrons in the n-region and to holes in

p-region. When this energy is sufficient to overcome the
potential barrier, a current of the order of a few miliamperes

begins to flow across the p-n junction. In this state the p-n
junction is said to be forward biased (Fig. 18.2 a). The
p-type

variation of current through the junction with the bias voltage
can be studied by the circuit shown in Fig. 18.2 (b). The value
of current for different values of bias voltage is noted and a

current-bias voltage graph is plotted. Fig. 18.3 shows the
graph for a typical low power silicon diode.

bond. As the covalent bond breaks, more electron-hole pairs
are created. Thus, minority charge carriers begin to multiply

Conversion of alternating current into direct current is called

rectification. Semi-conductor diodes are extensively used for

through the circuit in the path shown by arrows in Fig. 18.9 (b).

By comparing Figs. 18.9 (a) and 18.9 (b), it can be seen that

direction of current flow through the load resistance R is the

same in both the halves of the cycle. Thus both halves of the
alternating input voltage send a unidirectional current through
Fig. 18.9
R. The input and output voltages are shown in Fig. 18.10.
However the output voltage is not smooth but pulsating. It can
be made smooth by using a circuit known as filter.

emitter and collector. Usually the base is very thin, of the

It may be noted that polarities of the biasing batteries V and

practice, it is the n-p-n transistor that is generally used. So we
will discuss n-p-n transistors only.

Current Flow in a n-p-n Transistor
Fig. 18.18 (a) shows a n-p-n transistor at the instant when the
biasing voltage is applied. Electrons in the emitter, shown by
black dots, have not yet entered the base region. After the
application of the biasing voltage, emitter base junction is
forward biased, so emitter injects a large number of electrons

can flow in either of two directions. They can either flow out of

the base to the positive terminal of V BE or they can be
attracted towards the collector because of battery Vcc. CC* Since
the base is extremely thin, very few electrons manage to
(a)
recombine with holes and escape out of the base. Almost all
in
of the free electrons injected from the emitter into the base
are attracted by the collector due to the large positive
potential V CC (Fig. 18.18 c). Thus, in a normally biased
transistor due to above mentioned flow of electrons, we can
say, that an electronic current flows from the emitter into

In order to turn on the switch, a potential VB is applied
between control terminals B-E (Fig. 18 22 a). This injects a
large current IB into the base circuit due to which a very heavy
current IC begins to flow in the CE circuit. This large value of
collector current is possible only when the resistance
between C and E drops down to such a small value that the
mA
potential drop across CE is nearly 0.1 volt. In Fig. 18.22 (a)

bulb glows due to flow of large collector current. To turn the
switch OFF the base current IB is set zero by opening the
base circuit (Fig. 18.22 c). As I = IB , so I becomes zero
and C-E circuit becomes open (Fig. 18.22 d) Now the

resistance between C and E becomes nearly infinity which
opens the CE switch.

An electronic computer is basically a vast arrangement of
electronic switches which are made from transistors.
18.7 OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
As stated earlier, amplifier is an important electronic circuit
that is used in almost every electronic instrument. So instead
of making amplifier circuit by discrete components, the whole
amplifier is integrated on a small silicon chip and enclosed in
a capsule. Pins connected with working terminals such as
input, output and power supply project outside the capsule
Fig. 18.21
(Fig. 18.23 a). The enclosed circuit of the amplifier is used
by making requisite connections with these pins. Such as

As the open loop gain of the op-amp is very high (10°), even a
very small potential difference between the inverting and non-
inverting inputs is amplified to such a large extent that the
amplifier gets saturated, i.e., its output either becomes equal
to +Vcc or -Vcc. This feature of op-amp is used to compare two

During day time, when light is falling upon LDR, R1 is small.
According to Eq. 18.9, V' will be large such that
V'> VR so that Vo=-Vcc- The output of the op is connected with
a relay system which energizes only when Vo = +Vcc and then
it turns on the street lights. Thus when Vo = -Vcci the light will
not be switched ON.
As it gets darker, R1 becomes larger and V'decreases. When
V' becomes just less than VR the output of op-amp switches
to +Vcc which energizes the relay system and the street lights
are turned ON.

only two discrete values or states. Following are the
examples of such quantities.
(i)
Aswitch can be either open or closed.
(ii)
The answer of a question can be either yes or no.
(iii)
A certain statement can be either true or false.
(iv)
Abulb can be either off or on.
Various designations are used to represent the two
quantized states of such quantities. The most common of
these are listed in Table 18.1.

Mathematical manipulation of these quantities can be best
carried if they are represented by binary digits 1 and 0. When
we are dealing with voltages, designation No.2 is also a
convenient representation.
In describing functions of digital systems a closed switch will
be shown as 1 and open switch will be shown as 0. Similarly,
a lighted bulb will be described as 1 and an off bulb will be
described as 0.
Just as we require two basic mathematical operations, i.e.,
addition and subtraction for the mathematical manipulation
167

of ordinary quantities which can possess all continuous
values, we require a special algebra, known as Boolean
algebra for the manipulation of the quantities which have
values 1 and 0, now designated as Boolean variables.
Boolean algebra is based upon three basic operations
namely (i) AND operation, (ii) OR operation and (iii) NOT
operation. You have already read about these operations.
Here we would study about logic gates which implement
5V
these operations.
18.13 FUNDAMENTAL LOGIC GATES
for high
The electronic circuits which implement the various logic
2 V
operations are known as logic gates. In these gates the high
and low states, i.e., 1 and 0 states are simulated by certain
0.8 V
voltage levels. Ideally one particular voltage level represents
0 or low
a high (1) and another voltage level represents a low (0). In
0
practical digital circuits, however a 1 or high can be any
voltage between a specified minimum value and a specified
Fig. 18.34
maximum value. Likewise 0 or low can be any voltage
between a specified minimum and a specified maximum.
Fig. 18.34 shows the range 1 and 0 levels for a certain type of
Input A
digital gates. Thus if voltage of 3.5 V is applied to a gate, it will

accept it as high or 1. If a voltage of 0.5 V is applied, the gate

will recognize it as 0 or low.

It performs the operation of inversion or complementation.

level to its opposite level, i.e., it changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1. The
symbolic representation of NOT gate is shown in Fig. 18.37.

Whenever a bar is placed on any variable, it shows that the

18.15 APPLICATIONS OF GATES IN CONTROL
SYSTEMS
Gates are widely used in control systems. They control the
function of the system by monitoring some physical
parameter such as temperature, pressure or some other
physical quantity of the system. As gates operate with
electrical voltages only, so some devices are required which
can convert various physical quantities into electric voltage.
170
---

These devices are known as sensors. For example, in the
example of night switch, Light Dependent Resistance (LDR)
is a sensor for light because it can convert changes in the
intensity of light into electric voltage. A thermister is a sensor
T = Temperature sensor
for temperature. A microphone is a sound sensor. Similarly
P = Pressure sensor
T
P
there are level sensors which give an electrical signal when
the level of liquid in a vessel attains a certain limit. One such
C
application is described here. For example sensors are used
A
Circuit
to monitor the pressure and temperature of a chemical

solution stored in a vat. The circuitry for each sensor is such
that it produces a HIGH, i.e., 1 when either the temperature or
Fig. 18.43
pressure exceeds a specified value. A circuit is to be
designed which will ring an alarm when either the
Table 18.9
temperature or pressure or both cross the maximum

specified limit. The alarm requires a LOW(0) voltage for its

The block diagram of the problem is shown in Fig. .18.43 in

which C is the circuit to be designed. Its inputs A and B are fed
by the temperature and pressure sensors T and P fitted into
the vat. Whenever output of the circuit C is LOW, the alarm is
activated. So the circuit C should be such that its output is 0
as soon as the limit for temperature or pressure is exceeded,
i.e., when A = 0, B = 1 or when A = 1, B = 0 or when A=B=1.
P
The output of C should be HIGH when temperature and
pressure are within the specified limit, i.e., when A =B=0
A
This gives the truth table 18.9 which the circuit C has to
implement. It can be seen that it is the truth table of NOR

Alarm
gate. So the circuit C in Fig. 18.43 should be a NOR gate as
shown in Fig. 18.44.

SUMMARY
When an external potential difference is applied across a p-n junction such that
p-side is positive and n-side is negative, it is called forward biased.
When the external source of voltage is applied across a p-n junction such that its
positive terminal is connected to n-region and its negative terminal to p- region, the
-njunction is said to be reverse biased.
Conversion of alternating current into direct current is called rectification.
When only one half of alternating current cycle is converted into direct current, it is
called half-wave rectification.
Transistor is a semiconductor device consisting of three electrodes, namely emitter,
base and collector. For normal operation, the base-emitter junction is forward
biased whereas the collector-base junction is reverse biased.

Input resistance is the resistance between the positive and negative inputs of the
amplifier.
Outputresistance is the resistance between the output terminal and ground
Instead of making amplifier circuit by discrete components, the whole amplifier is
integrated on a small silicon chip and enclosed in a capsule, Pins connected with
working terminals such as inputs, outputs and power supply project outside the
capsule Such an integrated amplifier is known as operational amplifier
Open loop gain is the ratio of output voltage and the difference between non-
inverting and inverting inputs when there is no external connection between the
outputs and inputs.
A digital system deals with quantities or variables which have only two discrete
values or states.
The electronic circuits which implement the various logic operations are known as
logic gates,
