aterials have specific uses depending upon their characteristics and properties, such
as hardness, ductility, malleability, conductivity etc. What makes steel hard, lead soft, iron
magnetic and copper electrically conducting? It depends upon the structure -- the particular
order and bonding of atoms in a material. This clue has made it possible to design and
create materials with new and unusual properties for use in modern technology.
17.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS
Crystalline Solids
In crystalline solids there is a regular arrangement of molecules. The neighbours of every
molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant throughout the crystal. There is,
thus an ordered structure in crystalline solids.
135

The vast majority of solids, e.g., metals such as copper, iron

and zinc, ionic compounds such as sodium chloride,
ceramics such as zirconia are crystalline. The arrangement
of molecules, atoms or ions within all types of crystalline
solids can be studied using various X-ray techniques. It
should be noted that atoms, molecules or ions in a crystalline
solid are not static. For example, each atom in a metal crystal
Crystalline
vibrates about a fixed point with an amplitude that increases
with rise in temperature. It is the average atomic positions
which are perfectly ordered over large distances.
The cohesive forces between atoms, molecules or ions in
crystalline solids maintain the strict long-range order inspite
of atomic vibrations. For every crystal, however, there is a
temperature at which the vibrations become so great that the
structure suddenly breaks up, and the solid melts. The
transition from solid (order) to liquid (disorder) is, therefore,
abrupt or discontinuous. Every crystalline solid has a definite
melting point.

Amorphous or Glassy Solids

and long-range order.
The word amorphous means without form or structure. Thus
in amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of

molecules like that in crystalline solids. We can, therefore,
say that amorphous solids are more like liquids with the
disordered structure frozen in.
For example ordinary glass, which is a solid at ordinary
temperature, has no regular arrangement of molecules. On
heating, it gradually softens into a paste like state before it
becomes a very viscous liquid at almost 800Â°C. Thus
amorphous solids are also called glassy solids. This type of
solids have no definite melting point.

Crystal Lattice
A crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that
repeats itself over and over again. This smallest three
dimensional basic structure is called unit cell. The whole
structure obtained by the repetition of unit cell is known as
crystal lattice. For example, the pattern of NaCl particles
have a cube shape. The cube shape of the sodium chloride is
just one of several crystal shapes. In a cubic crystal all the

17.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF

Deformation in Solids
If we hold a soft rubber ball in our hand and then squeeze it,
the shape or volume of the ball will change. However, if we

stop squeezing the ball, and open our hand, the ball will
return to its original spherical shape. This has been illustrated
schematically in Fig. 17.1.

Similarly, if we hold two ends of a rubber string in our hands,
and move our hands apart to some extent, the length of the

examples, it is concluded that deformation (i.e., change in

subjected to some external force.

the atoms return to their equilibrium position, and the body
regains its original shape, provided that external applied
force was not too great. The ability of the body to return to its
original shape is called elasticity. Fig.17.2 illustrates
deformation produced in a unit cell of a crystal subjected to
an external applied force.
Stress and Strain
The results of mechanical tests are usually expressed in
terms of stress and strain, which are defined in terms of
(a) Unstretched unit cell
applied force and deformation.
Stress
It is defined as the force applied on unit area to produce any
change in the shape, volume or length of a body.
Mathematically it is expressed as

The SI unit of stress (o) is newton per square metre (Nm2),
which is given the name pascal (Pa).

Stress may cause a change in length, volume and shape.
When a stress changes length, it is called the tensile stress,
when it changes the volume it is called the volume stress and
when it changes the shape it is called the shear stress.
Strain
Strain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress
is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension,

known as elastic limit O. If the stress is increased beyond the

kind of behaviour is called plasticity.

increase the stretching force by increasing the weight. By
noting the extension e of the wire for different values of the
stretching force F, a graph can be drawn between the force F
and the extension l (Fig.17.5). If the elastic limit is not
exceeded, the extension is directly proportional to force F. As
the force F stretches the wire, it does some amount of work
on wire which is equal to product of force F and the extension
l. Suppose we are required to find the amount of the work

seen that it is represented by the area of the shaded strip. In
this way the total extension e, can be divided into very small
extensions and the work done during each of these small
extensions would be given by the area of the strips (Fig. 17.5).
So the total work done in producing the extension e is the sum
area of all these strips which is equal to area between the
graph and the axis on which extension has been plotted upto
l=l. In this case it equals to area of the triangle OAB.

This is the amount of energy stored in the wire. It is the gain in

The area method is quite a general one. For example if the
extension is increased from lot, the amount of work done
by the stretching force would be given by the area of the
trapezium ABCD (Fig. 17.5). It is also valid for both the linear
(elastic) and the non-linear (non-elastic) parts of the force-
extension graph. If the extension occurs from o to G
(Fig.17.5), this work done would be the area of OHG.
17.3 ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS
The fundamental electrical property of a solid is its response
to an applied electric field, i.e., its ability to conduct electric
current. The electrical behaviours of various materials are
142

diverse. Some are very good conductors, e.g., metals with
conductivities of the order of 107 (Qm) At the other extreme,
some solids, e.g., wood, diamond etc., have very low
conductivities ranging between 10 10 and 10 20 (Qm)` these
are called insulators. Solids with intermediate conductivities,
generally from 10 to 10 (Qm) are termed semiconductors,

atom failed to explain completely the vast diversity in the

arranged as in a liquid but fixed in
their relative positions.
On the other hand, energy band theory based on wave
mechanical model has been found successful in resolving
the problem.
Energy Band Theory
Electrons of an isolated atom are bound to the nucleus, and
can only have distinct energy levels. However, when a large
number of atoms, say N, are brought close to one another to
form a solid, each energy level of the isolated atom splits into
N sub-levels, called states, under the action of the forces
exerted by other atoms in the solid. These permissible
energy states are discrete but so closely spaced that they
appear to form a continuous energy band. In between two
consecutive permissible energy bands, there is a range of
energy states which cannot be occupied by electrons. These
are called forbidden energy states, and its range is termed as
forbidden energy gap.
The electrons in the outermost shell of an atom are called
valence electrons and the energy band occupying these
electrons is known as valence band. It is obviously the
highest occupied band. It may be either completely filled or
partially filled with electrons and can never be empty. The
band above the valence band is called conduction band. In
conduction band, electrons move freely and conduct electric
current through solids. That is why the electrons occupying
this band are known as conductive electrons or free
electrons. Any electron leaving the valence band is
accommodated by this band. It may be either empty or
partially filled with electrons. The bands below the valence
band are normally completely filled and as such play no part
in the conduction process. Thus, while discussing the
electrical conductivity we will consider only the valence and
conduction bands.
143

Insulators
Insulators are those materials in which
valence electrons are bound very tightly to their atoms and
are not free. In terms of energy bands, it means that an

free electrons for electrical conduction. In terms of energy
bands, conductors are those materials in which valence and
conduction bands largely overlap each other (Fig.17.7).

There is no physical distinction between the two bands which
ensures the availability of a large number of free electrons.

Fig. 17.7
At 0 K, there are no electrons in the conduction band and
their valence band are completely filled. It means at 0 K, a
piece of Ge or Si is a perfect insulator. However, with
increase in temperature, some electrons posses sufficient

energy to jump across the small energy gap from valence to
conduction band. This transfers some free electrons in the

conduction bands and creates some vacancies of electrons
in the valence band. The vacancy of electron in the valence

band is known as a hole. It behaves like a positive charge.
Thus at room temperature, Ge or Si crystal becomes a
semiconductor.
Fig. 17.8
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semi-conductor
Si
A semi-conductor in its extremely pure form is known as
intrinsic semi-conductor. The electrical behaviour of
semiconductor is extremely sensitive to the purity of the
material. It is substantially changed on introducing a small

amount of impurity into the pure semi-conductor lattice. The
process is called doping, in which a small number of atoms of
some other suitable elements are added as impurity in the
ratio of 1 to 106. The doped semi-conducting materials are
called extrinsic semi-conductors.
Fig. 17.9
Si

semi-conductors. These semi-conductor elements have
atoms with four valence electrons. In solid crystalline form,
the atoms of these elements arrange themselves in such a
pattern that each atom has four equidistant neighbours.
Fig. 17.9 shows this pattern along with its valence electrons.
Each atom with its four valence electrons, shares an electron
from its neighbours. This effectively allocates eight electrons
in the outermost shell of each atom which is a stable state.
This sharing of electrons between two atoms creates
P
covalent bonds. Due to these covalent bonds electrons are
bound in their respective shells.
Si
When a silicon crystal is doped with a pentavalent element,
Impurity Atom

e.g., arsenic, antimony or phosphorous etc., four valence
electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bond with the
(a)
four neighbouring Si atoms, while the fifth valence electron
provides a free electron in the crystal. Such a doped or
extrinsic semi-conductor is called n-type semi-conductor.
Fig. 17.10(a) illustrates silicon crystal lattice doped with a
pentavalent impurity such as phosphorous. The
phosphorous atom is called a donor atom because it readily
donates a free electron, which is thermally excited into the

conduction band.
On the other hand, when a silicon crystal is doped with a
trivalent element, e.g., aluminium, boron, gallium or indium

where an electron can be accommodated Such a semi-
conductor is called p-type semi-conductor. Fig. 17.10 (b)
illustrates silicon crystal lattice doped with aluminium. The
aluminium atom is called an acceptor atom because it is easy
for the aluminium ion core to accept a valence electron from a
nearby silicon atom, thus creating a hole in the valence bond.
Electrical Conduction by Electrons and Holes in
Semiconductors
Consider a semi-conductor crystal lattice, e.g., Ge or Si as
shown in Fig. 17.11. The circles represent the positiveion
cores of Si or Ge atoms, and the blue dots are valence
electrons. These electrons are bound by covalent bond.
However, at room temperature they have thermal kinetic

motion which, in case of some electrons, is so vigorous that

the covalent bond is unable to keep them bound. In such
cases the electrons break the covalent bond and get
themselves free leaving a vacant seat for an electron, i.e., a
hole. Thus whenever a covalent bond is broken, an electron-
hole pair is created. Both the electrons and the holes move in
the semi-conductor crystal lattice as explained below.

(Fig. 17.12 b,c) and positive charge appears at C. This
process is repeated between the atoms C and D with the
Fig. 17.12
result that the electron moves from D to C and the hole
(+ve charge) appears at D (Fig. 17.12 c,d) Thus we notice
that if a hole is present in any valence shell, it cannot stay
there but it moves from one atom to other with the electron
moving in opposite direction. Secondly we notice that the
appearance of hole is accompanied by a positive charge.
Thus a moving hole is equivalent to a moving positive charge.
Electron
In this example we have considered a special case in which

the electron and the hole are moving in a straight line.
Actually their motion is random because positively charged
core of the atom can attract an electron from any of its
+
neighbouring atoms.
Fig. 17.13
Thus, in semi-conductors there are two kinds of charge
carriers; a free electron (-e) and a hole e).
When a battery is connected to a semi-conductor, it
establishes an electric field across it due to which a directed
flow of electrons and holes takes place. The electrons drift
towards the positive end, whereas the holes drift towards the
negative end of the semi-conductor (Fig.17.13). The current I
flowing through the semi-conductor is carried by both
electrons and holes. It may be noted that the electronic current
and the hole current add up together to give the current I.

certain temperatures, conduct
electricity with no resistance.
The first superconductor was discovered in 1911 by
Kmaerlingh Ornes when it was observed that electrical
resistance of mercury disappears suddenly as the
temperature is reduced below 4.2 K. Some other metals such

as aluminium (T=1.18K), tin (T.=3.72K), and lead (T=7.2K)
also become superconductors at very low temperatures. In
1986 a new class of ceramic materials was discovered that
becomes superconductor at temperatures as high as 125 K.
Any superconductor with a critical temperature above 77 K,
the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, is referred as a high
temperature superconductor.
Recently a complex crystalline structure known as
Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBaCu. O) have been
reported to become superconductor at 163 K or -110 Â°C by
Prof, Yao Lian's Lee at Cambridge University. Perhaps one

17.5 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS
From the study of the magnetic fields produced by bar
magnets and moving charges, i.e., currents, it is possible to
trace the origin of the magnetic properties of the material. It is
observed that the field of a long bar magnet is like the field
produced by a long solenoid carrying current and the field of
a short bar magnet resembles that of a single loop
(Fig.17.15). This similarity between the fields produced by
magnets and currents urges an enquiring mind to think that
all magnetic effects may be due to circulating currents (i.e.,
moving charges); a view first held by Ampere. The idea was
not considered very favourably in Ampere's time because the
structure of atom was not known at that time. Taking into
consideration, the internal structure of atom, discovered

arise from two motions. First, each electron orbiting the
nucleus behaves like an atomic sized loop of current that
generates a small magnetic field; this situation is similar to the
field created by the current loop in Fig.17.15 (d). Secondly
each electron possesses a spin that also gives rise to a
magnetic field. The net magnetic field created by the
electrons within an atom is due to the combined field created
by their orbital and spin motions. Since there are a number of
electrons in an atom, their currents or spins may be so
oriented or aligned as to cancel the magnetic effects mutually

the electrons. Accepting this view of magnetism it is
concluded that it is impossible to obtain an isolated north
pole. The north-pole is merely one side of a current loop. The

atoms. Within each domain the magnetic fields of all the
spinning electrons are parallel to one another i.e., each
domain is magnetized to saturation. Each domain behaves as
a small magnet with its own north and south poles. In
unmagnetised iron the domains are oriented in a disorderly
fashion (Fig.17.16), so that the net magnetic effect of a
sizeable specimen is zero. When the specimen is placed in
an external magnetic field as that of a solenoid, the domains
line up parallel to lines of external magnetic field and the

combination of a solenoid and a specimen of iron inside it thus
makes a powerful magnet and is called an electromagnet.
Iron is a soft magnetic material. Its domains are easily
oriented on applying an external field and also readily return
to random positions when the field is removed. This is
desirable in an electromagnet and also in transformers.

Domains in steel, on the other hand, are not so easily
oriented to order. They require very strong external fields, but
once oriented, retain the alignment. Thus steel makes a good
permanent magnet and is known as hard magnetic material

for iron is about 750 Â°C.
Hysteresis Loop
To investigate a ferromagnetic material, a bar of that material
such as iron is placed in an alternating current solenoid. When
the alternating current is at its positive peak value, it fully
magnetises the specimen in one direction and when the current
is at its negative peak, it fully magnetises it in opposite direction.
Thus as the alternating current changes from its positive peak
value to its negative peak value and then back to its positive
peak value, the specimen undergoes a complete cycle of
magnetization. The flux density versus the magnetization
current of the specimen for the various values of magnetizing
current of the solenoid is plotted by a CRO (Fig. 1.17.18).

Its main features are as follows:
1. Hysteresis
The portion of OA of the curve is obtained when the
magnetizing current / is increased and AR is the portion when
the current is decreased. It may be noted that the value of flux
density for any value of current is always greater when the
current is decreasing than when it is increasing, i.e.,
magnetism lags behind the magnetizing current. This
phenomenon is known as hysteresis.

2. Saturation
R
The magnetic flux density increases from zero and reaches a
maximum value. At this stage the material is said to be
magnetically saturated.
3. Remanence or Retantivity
When the current is reduced to zero, the material still remains
strongly magnetized represented by point R on the curve. It is

4. Coercivity
To demagnetize the material, the magnetizing current is

reversed and increased to reduce the magnetization to zero.
This is known as coercive current represented by C on the
curve. The coercivity of steel (Fig.17.19 a), is more than that
of iron as more current is needed to demagnetize it. Once the
material is magnetized, its magnetization curve never
passes through the origin. Instead, it forms the closed loop
ACDC'A, which is called hysteresis loop.
5. Area of the Loop
The area of the loop is a measure of the energy needed to
magnetize and demagnetize the specimen during each cycle
of the magnetizing current. This is the energy required to do

magnetized or demagnetized, so they have large loop area
as compared to soft magnetic material such as iron which
can easily be magnetized. The energy dissipated per cycle,
thus, for iron is less than for steel.

Suitability of magnetic materials for different purposes can be
studied by taking the specimen through a complete cycle and
drawing the hysteresis loop. A material with high retentivity
and large coercive force would be most suitable to make a
permanent magnet. The cores of electromagnets used for
alternating currents where the specimen repeatedly

SUMMARY
Crystalline solids are those in which there is a regular arrangement of molecules.
The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is constant
through out the crystal. Thus, there is an ordered structure in crystalline solids.
In amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules. These are more
like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.
Polymers may be said to be more or less solid materials with a structure that is
intermediate between order and disorder. These can be classified as partially or
poorly crystalline solids.
A crystalline solid consists of three dimensional pattern that repeats itself over and
over again. This basic structure is called unit cell.
The force applied on unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length
of a body is called stress.
When a long wire of length l with area of cross section A is being pulled by a force F,
which results in an increase in length Al, the stress is called tensile deformation.
When a small cylinder is subjected to a force F along the inward drawn normal to its
area of cross section A to reduce its length, the stress is called compressive stress
and deformation produced by it is called compressive deformation.
If a force F is applied tangentially to the surface of the opposite face of a cube to
deform or twist it through an angle 0, the stress is termed as shear stress.
Strain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the
case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in
length per unit length. If strain is due to tensile stress, it is called tensile strain and if it
is produced as a result of compressive stress, it is termed as compressive strain.
The ratio of stress to strain is a constant for a given material, provided the external
applied force is not too great. This is called modulus of elasticity.
The strain energy can be obtained by the area of the force-extension graph.
The electrical behaviour of semi-conductor is substantially changed on introducing

a small amount of impurity into the pure semi-conductor lattice. The process is called
doping in which a small number of atoms of some other suitable elements are added
as impurity. The doped semi-conducting materials are called extrinsic.
When a silicon crystal is doped with a pentavalent element, four valence electrons of
the impurity atom form covalent bond with the neighbouring Si atoms, while the fifth
valence electron provides a free electron in the crystal. Such a doped or extrinsic
semi-conductor is called n-type semi-conductor.
There are some materials whose resistivity becomes zero below a certain
temperature To called critical temperature. Below this temperature, such materials
are called superconductors.
Substances in which the orbits and the spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so
oriented that their magnetic fields support each other and the atom behaves like a
tiny magnet are called paramagnetic substances.
The substances in which magnetic fields produced by orbital and spin molecules of
the electrons add up to zero are called diamagnetic substances.
Substances in which the atoms co-operate with each other in such a way so as
to exhibit a strong magnetic effect are called ferromagnetic.
