S soon as Oersted discovered that electric currents produce magnetic fields, many
scientists began to look for the reverse effect, that is, to cause an electric current by means
of a magnetic field. In 1831 Michael Faraday in England and at the same time Joseph Henry
in USA observed that an emf is set up in a conductor when it moves across a magnetic field.
If the moving conductor was connected to a sensitive galvanometer, it would show an
electric current flowing through the circuit as long as the conductor is kept moving in the
magnetic field. The emf produced in the conductor is called induced emf, and the current
generated is called the induced current. This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic
induction.

15.1 INDUCED EMF AND INDUCED CURRENT
There are many ways to produce induced emf. Fig. 15.1
illustrates one of them. Consider a straight piece of wire of
length l placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet.
N
The wire is connected to a sensitive galvanometer. This
Current
forms a closed path or loop without any battery. In the
G
beginning when the loop is at rest in the magnetic field, no
current is shown by the galvanometer. If we move the loop
from left to right, the length l of the wire is dragged across the
Direction
magnetic field and a current flows through the loop. As we
of motion
stop moving the loop, current also stops. Now, if we move the
loop in opposite direction, current also reverses its direction.
S
This is indicated by the deflection of the galvanometer in
opposite direction.
The induced current depends upon the speed with which
Fig.15.1
conductor moves and upon the resistance of the loop. If we
change the resistance of the loop by inserting different
resistors in the loop, and move it in the magnetic field with the
same speed every time, we find that the product of induced
current / and the resistance R of the loop remains constant, i.e.,
1xF = constant
This constant is the induced emf. The induced emf leads to
an induced current when the circuit is closed. The current can
be increased by
1)
using a stronger magnetic field
ii)
moving the loop faster
iii)
replacing the loop by a coil of many turns
If we perform the above experiment in the other way, i.e.,
instead of moving the loop across the magnetic field, we
keep the loop stationary and move the magnet, then it can be
easily observed that the results are the same. Thus, it can be
concluded that it is the relative motion of the loop and the
magnet that causes the induced emf.
In fact, this relative motion changes the magnetic flux through
the loop, therefore, we can say that an induced emf is
produced in a loop if the magnetic flux through it changes.
The greater the rate of change of flux, the larger is the
induced emf.
There are some other methods described below in which an
emf is induced in a loop by producing a change of magnetic
82

flux through it.
1.
Fig.15.2 (a) shows a bar magnet and a coil of wire to
Stationary
which a galvanometer is connected. When there is no
3
N
relative motion between the magnet and the coil, the
galvanometer indicates no current in the circuit. As
soon as the bar magnet is moved towards the coil, a
(a)
current appears in it (Fig 15.2 b). As the magnet is
moved, the magnetic flux through the coil changes,
G
and this changing flux produces the induced current in
the coil. When the magnet moves away from the coil,
a current is again induced but now in opposite
S
direction. The current would also be induced if the
magnets were held stationary and the coil is moved.
2.
There is another method in which the current is
(b)
G
induced in a coil by changing the area of the coil in a
constant magnetic field. Fig. 15.3 (a) shows that no
Fig. 15.2
current is induced in the coil of constant area placed
in a constant magnetic field. However, when the coil
is being distorted so as to reduce its area, (Fig. 15.3 b)
an induced emf and hence current appears. The
current vanishes when the area is no longer
changing. If the distorted coil is brought to its original
x

circular shape thereby increasing the area, an
oppositely directed current is induced which lasts as

An induced current can also be generated when a coil

field. Here, also, the magnetic flux through the coil

electric generators.

a nearby coil. Fig. 15.5 shows two coils placed side by
P
S
side. The coil P is connected in series with a battery, a
rheostat and a switch, while the other coil S is
connected to a galvanometer only. Since there is no
battery in the coil S, one might expect that the current
through it will always be zero. Now, if the switch of the
coil P is suddenly closed, a momentary current is
induced in coil S. This is indicated by the
Switch
open
galvanometer, which suddenly deflects and then
returns to zero. No induced current exists in coil S as
long as the current flows steadily in the coil P. An
P
S
oppositely directed current is induced in the coil S at
the instant the switch of coil P is opened. Actually, the
current in P grows from zero to its maximum value
just after the switch is closed. The current comes
down to zero when the switch is opened. Due to
change in current, the magnetic flux associated with

the coil P changes momentarily. This changing flux is
closed
also linked with the coil S that causes the induced
Fig. 15.5
current in it. Current in coil P can also be changed
with the help of rheostat.
5.
It is also possible to link the changing magnetic flux
with a coil by using an electromagnet instead of a
permanent magnet. The coil is placed in the magnetic
field of an electromagnet (Fig. 15.6). Both the coil and
Electromagnet
the electromagnet are stationary. The magnetic flux
through the coil is changed by changing the current of
the electromagnet, thus producing the induced
N
current in the coil.
15.2 MOTIONAL EMF
Coil
In the previous section we have studied that when a
S
conductor is moved across a magnetic field, an emf is
induced between its ends. The emf of the moving conductor
Current
is similar to that of a battery, i.e., if the ends of the conductor
are joined by a wire to make a closed circuit, a current flows
Fig. 15.6
through it.
The emf induced by the motion of a conductor
across a magnetic field is called motional emf.
Consider a conducting rod of length L placed on two parallel
metal rails separated by a distance L. A galvanometer is
connected between the ends C and d of the rails. This forms a
complete conducting loop abcda (Fig. 15.7a), A uniform
84

magnetic field B is applied directed into the page. Initially

when the rod is stationary, galvanometer indicates no current

in the loop. If the rod is pulled to the right with constant
velocity V, the galvanometer indicates a current flowing
through the loop. Obviously, the current is induced due to the
motion of the conducting rod across the magnetic field. The
moving rod is acting as a source of emf = Vb - Va = AV.
When the rod moves, a charge q within the rod also moves

with the same velocity V in the magnetic field B and
Fig. 15.7(a)
experiences a force given by
F=qvxB
The magnitude of the force is
F=qvBsin 9
Since angle 0 between V and B is 90°, so
F=qvB
Applying the right hand rule, we see that F is directed from a
to b in the rod. As a result the charge migrates to the top end
of the conductor. As more and more of the charges migrate,
concentration of the charge is produced at the top b and
deficiency of charges at the bottom a. This redistribution of
charge sets up an electrostatic field E directed from b to a.
The electrostatic force on the charge is F® e = qE directed from
b to a. The system quickly reaches an equilibrium state in
which these two forces on the charge are balanced. If E0 is
the electric intensity in this state then
qEo=qvB
Eo=vB
(15.1)
The motional emf E will be equal to the potential difference
AV, AV = Vb - V between the two ends of the moving
conductor in this equilibrium state. The gradient of potential
will be given by AVIL. As the electric intensity is given by the
negative of the gradient, therefore,

The motional emf
AV ==LVB
(15.3)
This is the magnitude of motional emf. However, if the angle
between V and B is 0, then
8=-vBL sin
(15.4)
Due to induced emf positive charges would flow along the
path abcda, therefore the induced current is anticlockwise in
the diagram. As the current flows, the quantity of the charge at
the top decreases so the electric intensity decreases but the

reach the end a of the conductor due to current flow, they are
carried to the top end b of the conductor by the unbalanced
magnetic field and the current continues to flow.

15.3 FARADAY'S LAW AND INDUCED EMF
The motional emf induced in a rod moving perpendicular to
a
magnetic field is E = -vBL. The motional emf as well as other
induced emfs can be described in terms of magnetic flux.
Consider the experiment shown in Fig. 15.8 again. Let the

small interval of time At. The distance travelled by the rod in

Although the above expression is derived on the basis of
motional emf, but it is true in general. This conclusion was
first arrived at by Faraday, so this is known as Faraday's law
of electromagnetic induction which states that
A cooper ring passes through a
rectangle region where a constant
magnetic field is directed into the

loops is equal to the negative of the rate at which the

and 4?
magnetic flux through the coil is changing with time".

The minus sign indicates that the direction of the induced emf
is such that it opposes the change in flux.
Example 15.2: A loop of wire is placed in a uniform
magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop.
The strength of the magnetic field is 0.6 T. The area of the
loop begins to shrink at a constant rate
What is the magnitude of emf induced in the loop while it is

15.4 LENZ'S LAW AND DIRECTION OF
INDUCED EMF
In the previous section, a mathematical expression of the
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction was derived as
E
E=-NOO
The minus sign in the expression is very important. It has to
do with the direction of the induced emf. To determine the
?
direction we use a method based on the discovery made by
the Russian Physicist Heinrich Lenz in 1834. He found that
the polarity of an induced emf always leads to an induced
current that opposes, through the magnetic field of the
induced current, the change inducing the emf. The rule is
known as Lenz's law which states that
"The direction of the induced current is always so
as to oppose the change which causes the current".
88
---

The Lenz's law refers to induced currents and not to induced
emf, which means that we can apply it directly to closed
conducting loops or coils. However, if the loop is not closed
we can imagine as if it were closed, and then from the
direction of induced current, we can find the direction of the
induced emf.
Let us apply the Lenz's law to the coil in which current is
induced by the movement of a bar magnet. We know that a
current carrying coil produces a magnetic field similar to that
of a bar magnet. One face of the coil acts as the north pole
while the other one as the south pole. If the coil is to oppose
the motion of the bar magnet, the face of the coil towards the
magnet must become a north pole (Fig. 15.9). The two north
poles will then repel each other. The right hand rule applied to
V
S
N
N
S
current is
anti-clockwise
Fig. 15.9
the coil suggests that the induced current must be anti-
clockwise as seen from the side of the bar magnet.
According to Lenz's law the "push' of the magnet is the
"change" that produces the induced current, and the current
acts to oppose the push. On the other hand if we pull the
magnet away from the coil the induced current will oppose
the "pull" by creating a south pole on the face of coil towards
the bar magnet.
The Lenz's law is also a statement of law of conservation of
energy that can be conveniently applied to the circuits
involving induced currents. To understand this, consider once
again the experiment in Fig. 15.8. When the rod moves
towards right, emf is induced in it and an induced current flows
through the loop in the anti-clockwise direction. Since the
89

changes. Since the secondary coil is in the magnetic field of
the primary, the changing flux also links with the secondary.
This causes an induced emf in the secondary.
The phenomenon in which a changing
current in one coil induces an emf in
another coil is called the mutual induction.
According to Faraday's law, the emf induced in the
secondary coil is proportional to the rate of change of flux

Let the flux passing through one loop of the secondary coil be

flux is proportional to the magnetic field produced by the
current Ip in the primary and the magnetic field itself is
proportional to Ip, therefore
N,0,= MI,

Where M== M
is proportionality constant called the
mutual inductance of the two coils. It depends upon the
number of turns of the coils, their area of cross - section, their
closeness together and the nature of the core material upon
which the two coils are wound.
By Faraday's law the emf induced in the secondary coil is
given by the rate of change of flux through the secondary.

(15.10)
The Eq.15.10 shows that the emf induced in the secondary is
proportional to the time rate of change of current in the primary.
91
---

The negative sign in Eq. .15.10 indicates the fact that the
induced emf is in such a direction that it opposes the change
of current in the primary coil. While finding out the value of M
from Eq. 15.10, negative sign is ignored. Thus M may be
defined as the ratio of average emf induced in the secondary
to the time rate of change of current in the primary.
M=Ai./ M =
At
The SI unit for the mutual inductance M is Vs A1, which is
called as henry (H) after Joseph Henry.
One henry is the mutual inductance of the pair of coils in
which the rate of change of current of one ampere per second
in the primary causes an induced emf of one volt in the
secondary.
Example 15.3: An emf of 5.6 V is induced in a coil while the
current in a nearby coil is decreased from 100 A to
20 A in 0.02 S. What is the mutual inductance of the two coils?
If the secondary has 200 turns, find the change in flux during
this interval.
Solution:

15.6 SELF INDUCTION
According to Faraday's law, the change of flux through a coil
by any means induces an emf in it. In all the examples we have
discussed so far, induced emf was produced by a changing
magnetic flux from some external source. But the change of
flux through a coil may also be due to a change of current in
the coil itself.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 15.12. A coil is connected in
series with a battery and a rheostat. Magnetic flux is produced
through the coil due to current in it. If the current is changed by
S
varying the rheostat quickly, magnetic flux through the coil
Rheostat
changes that causes an induced emf in the coil. Such an emf
is called as self induced emf.
Fig. 15.12
The phenomenon in which a changing current in a
coil induces an emf in itself is called self induction.
If the flux through one loop of the coil be 0. then the total flux
through the coil of N turns would be N O As is proportional
to the magnetic field which is in turn proportional to the
current I, therefore

is the constant of proportionality called the self
inductance of the coil. It depends upon the number of turns of
the coil, its area of cross-section and the core material. By
winding the coil around a ferromagnetic (iron) core, the
magnetic flux and hence the inductance can be increased
significantly relative to that for an air core.
By Faraday's Law, , emf induced in the coil is

Putting NO = LI from 15.11

E1 = At
or
E1 = - L At

---

The Eq.15.12 shows that the self induced emf in a coil is
proportional to the time rate of change of current in the coil.
Self inductance L of a coil may be defined as the ratio of the
emf to the rate of change of current in the coil. The unit of L is
also henry (H).
The negative sign in Eq.15.12 indicates that the self induced
emf must oppose the change that produced it. That is why the
self induced emf is sometimes called as back emf. This is
exactly in accord with the Lenz's law. If the current is increased,
the induced emf will be opposite to that of battery and if the
current is decreased the induced emf will aid, rather than
opposing the battery. Because of their self inductance, coils of
wire are known as inductors, and are widely used in electronics.
In alternating current, inductors behave like resistors.
Example 15.4: The current in a coil of 1000 turns is
changed from 5 A to zero in 0.2 S. If an average emf of
50 V is induced during this interval, what is the self
inductance of the coil? What is the flux through each turn of
the coil when a current of 6A is flowing?

15.7 ENERGY STORED IN AN INDUCTOR
We have studied in chapter 12 that energy can be stored in
the electric field between the plates of a capacitor. In a similar
manner, energy can be stored in the magnetic field of an
inductor.
Consider a coil connected to a battery and a switch in series
(Fig. 15.13). When the switch is turned on voltage V is applied
across tho ends of the coil and current through it rises from
zero to its maximum value I. Due to change of current, an emf

As in case of a capacitor, energy is stored in the electric field
between the plates, likewise, in an inductor, energy is stored
in the magnetic field. Therefore, Eq. 15.15 can be expressed
in terms of the magnetic field B of a solenoid which has n turns

15.8 ALTERNATING CURRENT GENERATOR
R
We have learnt that when a current carrying coil is placed in a
magnetic field, a torque acts on it that rotates the coil. What
R
Carbon
happens if a coil of wire is rotated in a magnetic field? Can a
d
brush
current be produced in the coil? Yes, it does. Such a device is
called a current generator.
A current generator is a device that converts
mechanical energy into electrical energy.
N
S
The principle of an electric generator is based on Faraday's
b
law of electromagnetic induction. When a coil is rotated in a
magnetic field by some mechanical means, magnetic flux
through the coil changes, and consequently an emf is
(Front view)
induced in the coil.
If the generator is connected to an external circuit, an electric
Fig.15.14
current is the output of the generator.
Let a rectangular loop of wire of area A be placed in a uniform
magnetic field B (Fig.15.14). The loop is rotated about z-axis
through its centre at constant angular velocity (3). One end of the
loop is attached to a metal ring R and the other end to the ring
R'. These rings, called the slip rings are concentric with the axis
of the loop and rotate with it. Rings RR' slide against stationary
carbon brushes to which external circuit is connected.
d
To calculate the induced emf in the loop, consider its position
N
S
(Fig.15.15) while it is rotating anticlockwise. The figure shows the
top view of the coil. The vertical side ab of the loop is moving with
velocity V in the magnetic field B. If the angle between V and B
(Top view)
be 0, the motional emf induced in the side ab has the magnitude,
Fig. 15.15
Eab = vBL sinO
97
---

The direction of induced current in the wire ab is the same as
that of force F experienced by the charges in the wire, i.e.,
from top to the bottom. The same amount of emf is induced in
the side cd but the direction of current is from bottom to the
top.
Therefore
sin 0
The net contribution to emf by sides bc and da is zero
because the force acting on the charges inside bc and da is
not along the wire.
Thus
Since both the émfs in the sides ab and cd drive current in the
same direction around the loop, the total emf in the loop is
E=Ea++E.co
E=vBLsin0 +vBLsin8
E=2vBLsin9
If the loop is replaced by a coil of N turns, the total emf in the
coil will be,
E=2 NvBL sinG
(15.21)
A
The linear speed V of the vertical wire is related to the angular
speed w by the relation
v=wr
where r is the distance of the vertical wires from the centre of
the coil. Substituting or for vin Eq. (15.21)
We get
e=2N(wr) BL sine
B sine
E = Nw AB sin 0
(15.22)
where A=2rL = area of the coil
As the angular displacement 0 = wt, so the Eq. 15.22 becomes
E No AB sin(wt)
(15.23)
Eq. 15.23 shows that the induced emf varies sinusoidally with
time.
It has the maximum value E0 when sin (wt) is equal to 1. Thus
Eg ==No AB
(15.24)
98
---

The Eq. 15.23 can be written as,
E Eo sin (ct)
(15.25)
If R is the resistance of the coil, then by Ohm's law, induced
current in the coil will be
sin(wt) R so R sin(wt)
or
I =1o sin(wt)
(15.26)
where 1g is maximum current.
Angular speed w of the coil is related to its frequency of
rotation fas, (1) = 2 f
The Eqs.15.25 and 15.26 can be written as
E = sosin(2nft)
(15.27)
/ = I,sin (2nft)
(15.28)
Eq. 15.28 indicates the variation of current as a function of
0 = 2xft. Fig. 15.16 shows the graph for the current
corresponding to different positions of one loop of the coil.

When the angle between V & B is 0 = 0°, the plane of the loop
Fig. 15.16
is perpendicular to B, current is zero. As 0 increases, current
also increases and at 0 = 90° = /2 rad, the loop is parallel to
B, current is maximum, directed along abcda. On further
increase in 0 current decreases, and at 0 = 180° = TO rad the
current becomes zero as the loop is again perpendicular to B.
For 180° < A < 270° current increases but reverses its
direction as is clear from the figure. Current is now directed
along dcbad. At 0 = 270° = 3 /2 rad, current is maximum in

the reverse direction as the loop is parallel to B.
At 0 = 360° = 2 rad, one rotation is completed, the loop is
perpendicular to B and the current decreases to zero. After
one rotation the cycle repeats itself. The current alternates in
For Your Information
direction once in one cycle. Therefore, such a current is
called the alternating current. It reverses its direction
f times per second.
In actual practice a number of coils are wound around an iron
cylinder which is rotated in the magnetic field. This assembly
is called an armature. The magnetic field is usually provided
by an electromagnet. Armature is rotated by a fuel engine or a
turbine run by a waterfall. In some commercial generators,
field magnet is rotated around a stationary armature.
Example 15.6: An alternating current generator operating at
50 Hz has a coil of 200 turns. The coil has an area of 120 cm².
What should be the magnetic field in which the coil rotates in
order to produce an emf of maximum value of 240 volts?
Solution:

15.9 D.C. GENERATOR
Alternating current generators are not suitable for many
applications, for example, to run a D.C. Motor. In 1834,
William Sturgeon invented a simple device called a
commutator that prevents the direction of current from
100
---

changing. Therefore a D.C. generator is similar to the A.C.
generator in construction with the difference that
A'
"slip rings" are replaced by "split rings". The "split rings" are
A
B
two halves of a ring that act as a commutator. Fig. 15.17
B
shows the "split rings" Aand A attached to the two ends of the
coil that rotates in the magnetic field. When the current in the
coil is zero and is about to change direction, the split rings
also change the contacts with the carbon brushes BB'. In this
way the output from BB' remains in the same direction,
although the current is not constant in magnitude. The curve
Fig. 15.17
of the current is shown in Fig. 18. It is similar to a sine curve
with the lower half inverted. The fluctuations of the output can
be significantly reduced by using many coils rather than a
single one. Multiple coils are wound around a cylindrical core
to form the armature. Each coil is connected to a separate
commutator and the output of every coil is tapped only as it
reaches its peak emf. Thus the emf in the outer circuit is
almost constant.

BACK MOTOR EFFECT IN
GENERATORS
Agenerator is the source of electricity production. Practically,
the generators are not so simple as described above. A large
a
turbine is turned by high pressure steam or waterfall. The
d
shaft of the turbine is attached to the coil which rotates in a
F.
magnetic field. It converts the mechanical energy of the
B
driven turbine to electrical energy. The generator supplies
current to the external circuit. The devices in the circuit that
B
F2
consume electrical energy are known as the "load". The
/
greater the load the larger the current is supplied by the
generator. When the circuit is open, the generator does not
c
supply electrical energy, and a very little force is needed to
rotate the coil. As soon as the circuit is closed, a current is
drawn through the coil. The magnetic field exerts force on the

the coil. Force F, is acting on the left side of the coil whereas

energy consumed by the "load" must come from the "energy
source" used to drive the turbine.
15.11 D.C. MOTOR
A motor is a device which converts electrical energy into
mechanical energy. We already know that a wire carrying
current placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. This is
the basic principle of an electric motor. In construction a D.C
motor is similar to a D.C generator, having a magnetic field, a
commutator and an armature. In the generator, the armature
F
is rotated in the magnetic field and current is the output. In the
D.C motor, current passes through the armature that rotates
B
in the magnetic field. In the D.C motor, the brushes are
connected to a D.C supply or battery (Fig.15.20). When
N
S
current flows through the armature coil, the force on the
-F
conductors produces a torque, that rotates the armature. The
amount of this torque depends upon the current, the strength
of the magnetic field, the area of the coil and the number of
turns of the coil.
If the current in the coil were all the time in the same direction,
the torque on it would be reversed after each half revolution.
But at this moment, commutator reverses the direction of
Fig. 15.20
current that keeps the torque always in the same sense. A
little problem arises due to the use of commutator, that is, the
torque vanishes each time the current changes its direction.
This creates jerks in the smooth running of the armature.
However the problem is overcome by using more than one
coil wrapped around a soft-iron core. This results in
producing a more steady torque.
The magnetic field in the motor, is provided by a permanent
magnet or an electromagnet. The windings of the
electromagnet are usually called the field coils. The field coils
may be in series or in parallel to the armature coils.
15.12 BACK EMF EFFECT IN MOTORS
A motor is just like a generator running in reverse. When the
coil of the motor rotates across the magnetic field by the
applied potential difference V. an emf E is induced in it. The
induced emf is in such a direction that opposes the emf
running the motor. Due to this reason the induced emf is
called back emf of the motor. The magnitude of the back emf
increases with the speed of motor.
Since Vand E are opposite in polarity, the net emf in the circuit
is V - E. If R is the resistance of the coil and / the current drawn
102
---

by the motor, then by Ohm's law
1=V-i
V-8
or V=E+IR
R
(15.29)
When the motor is just started, back emf is almost zero and
hence a large current passes through the coil. As the motor
speeds up, the back emf increases and the current becomes
smaller and smaller. However, the current is sufficient to
provide torque on the coil to drive the load and to overcome
losses due to friction. If the motor is overloaded, it slows
down. Consequently, the back emf decreases and allows the
motor to draw more current. If the motor is overloaded
beyond its limits, the current could be so high that it may
burn out the motor.
Example 15.7: A permanent magnet D.C motor is run by a
battery of 24 volts. The coil of the motor has a resistance of
2 ohms. It develops a back emf of 22.5 volts when driving the
load at normal speed. What is the current when motor just
starts up? Also find the current when motor is running at
normal speed.
Solution:
Operation Voltage = V=24V
Resistance of the coil = R=20
Back emf = E=22.5V
Current =1 =??

15.13 TRANSFORMER
A transformer is an electrical device used to change a given
alternating emf into a larger or smaller alternating emf. It
103
---

works on the principle of mutual induction between two coils.
In principle, the transformer consists of two coils of copper,
electrically insulated from each other, wound on the same
iron core. The coil to which A.C power is supplied is called
primary and that from which power is delivered to the circuit is
called the secondary.
It should be noted that there is no electrical connection
between the two coils but they are magnetically linked.
Suppose that an alternating emf is applied to the primary. If at
some instant t the flux in the primary is changing at the rate of
AO/At then there will be back emf induced in the primary
which will oppose the applied voltage. The instantaneous
value of the self induced emf is given by
Self induced
If the resistance of the coil is negligible then the back emf is
equal and opposite to applied voltage V
Vp=-back = emf
(15.30)
where No is the number of turns in the primary.
Assuming the flux through the primary also passes through the
secondary, i.e., the two coils are tightly coupled, the rate of
change of flux in the secondary will also be /t and the
magnitude of the induced emf across the secondary is given by
(15.31)

secondary is less than the number in primary, then V, < Vpr
(b)
Step down transformer
such transformer in which voltage across secondary is less

than the primary voltage is called a step down transformer

---

It is important to note that the electrical power in a
transformer is transformed from its primary to the secondary
coil by means of changing flux. For an ideal case the power
input to the primary is nearly equal to the power output from
the secondary i.e.,
Power input = Power output
i.e.

Ig is the current in the primary and I, in the secondary. The
currents are thus inversely proportional to the respective
voltages. Therefore, in a step up transformer when the
voltage across the secondary is raised, the value of current is
reduced. This is the principle behind its use in the electric
supply network where transformer increases the voltage and
reduces the current so that it can be transmitted over long
distances without much power loss. When current I passes
through a resistance R, the power loss due to heating effect is
12R. Suppose R is the resistance of transmission line. In order
to minimize the loss during transmission, it is not possible to
reduce R because it requires the use of thick copper wire
which becomes highly uneconomical. The purpose is well
served by reducing I. At the generating power station the
Transformer symbol
voltage is stepped up to several thousand of volts and power
is transmitted at low current to long distances without much
loss. Step down transformers then decrease the voltage to a
safe value at the end of line where the consumer of electric
power is located. Inside a house a transformer may be used
to step down the voltage from 250 volts to 9 volts for ringing
bell or operating a transistor radio. Transformers with several
secondaries are used in television and radio receivers where
several different voltages are required.
Only in an ideal transformer the output power is nearly equal
to the input power. But in an actual transformer, this in not the
case. The output is always less than input due to power
losses. There are two main causes of power loss, namely-
eddy currents and magnetic hysteresis.
In order to enhance the magnetic flux, the primary and
secondary coils of the transformer are wound on soft iron
core. The flux generated by the coils also passes through the
core. As magnetic flux changes through a solid conductor,
induced currents are set up in closed paths in the body of the
105
---

conductor. These induced currents are set up in a direction
perpendicular to the flux and are known as eddy currents. It
results in power dissipation and heating of the core material.

Due to these power losses, a transformer is far from being an
ideal. Its output power is always less than its input power. The
efficiency of a transformer is defined as
E-OUTDUT power x 100
power
In order to improve the efficiency, care should be exercised,
to minimize all the power losses. For example core should be
assembled from the laminated sheets of a material whose
hysteresis loop area is very small. The insulation between
lamination sheets should be perfect so as to stop the flow of
eddy currents. The resistance of the primary and secondary
coils should be kept to a minimum. As power transfer from
primary to secondary takes place through flux linkages, so
the primary and secondary coils should be wound in such a
way that flux coupling between them is maximum.
Example 15.8: The turns ratios of a step up transformer is
50. A current of 20 A is passed through its primary coil at
220 volts. Obtain the value of the voltage and current in the

SUMMARY
An emf is set up in a conductor when it moves across a magnetic field. It is called an
induced emf.
The emf induced by the motion of a conductor across a magnetic field is called
motional emf.
Magnitude of motional emf in a rod of length L moving with velocity V across a
magnetic field of strength B making Owithitise=vBLsine
Faraday's law states that the emf induced in a conducting coil of
Nloops is equal to the negative of the rate at which the magnetic flux through the coil
is changing with time.
The Lenz's law states that the direction of the induced current is always so as to
oppose the change which causes the current.
The phenomenon in which a changing current in one coil induces an emf in another
coil is called the mutual induction.
One henry is the mutual inductance of that pair of coils in which a change of current
of one ampere per second in the primary causes an induced emf of one volt in the
secondary.
The phenomenon in which a changing current in a coil induces an emf in itself is
called self induction.
A current generator is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical
energy.
The emf produced in a generator.is E NwAB sin(wt) or E=E.sin(2rft).
Amotor is a device, which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
The induced emf in a motor opposes the emf running the motor. This induced emf is
called the back emf of the motor.
