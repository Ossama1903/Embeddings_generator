8.1    INTRODUCTION
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds which contain carbon and hydro -
gen only. The number of such compounds is very large because of the prop -
erty of catenation. Hydrocarbons have been divided into various class-
es on the basis of structure of the chain or size and nature of the ring.3
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.PunjabIf all the valencies of the carbon atoms in a molecule are fully satisfied and
these cannot further take up any more hydrogen atoms, then thehydrocarbons are named as saturated hydrocarbons or alkanes. The compounds of carbon and hydrogen in which all the four valen-cies of carbon are not fully utilized and they contain either a double or a triple bond, such compounds are called unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Those unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain a double bond are called alkenes while those containing a triple bond are called alkynes.Classification of hydrocarbons has been’ shown at page 136.
8.2 NOMENCLATURE
8.2.1 Common or Trivial Names:
In the early days, the compounds were named on the basis of their history, the method of preparation or name of the person working on it, e.g., the name marsh gas was given to methane because it was found in marshy places. Acetic acid derives its name from vinegar (Latin, acetum means vinegar). Organic compounds were named after a person, like barbituric acid after Barbara. Such a system may have a certain charm but is never manageable.
For alkanes with five or more carbon atoms, the root word is derived from 
the Greek or Latin numerals indicating the number of carbon atoms in a molecule, and the name is completed by adding ‘ane’ as a suffix, e.g. pentane (C
5H12), hexane (C6H14), heptane (C7H16), etc. The common or 
trivial names are applicable to all isomers of a given molecular formula. The prefixes n, iso, neo are, however, to differentiate between isomers.4

These prefixes have only limited use, as they are not workable with

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab8.2.2 IUPAC Names
In 1889 the solution for naming the organic compounds systematically 
was sought by International Chemical Congress. A report was accepted in 1892 in Geneva but it was found incomplete. In 1930, International Union of Chemistry (IUC) gave a modified report which is also referred as Liege Rules. This report was further modified by International union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC) in the year 1947. Since that date the union has issued periodic reports on rules for the systematic nomenclature of organic compounds, the most recent of which was published in the year 1979. IUPAC system of nomenclature is based on the following principle. 
‘Each different compound should have a different name’ .Thus through a systematic set of rules, the IUPAC system provides different names for more than 7 million known organic compounds.
Nomenclature of Alkyl Groups:
If we remove one hydrogen atom from an alkane, we obtain what is called an alkyl group. These alkyl groups have names that end in —yl.When the alkane is unbranched and the hydrogen atom that is removed is a terminal hydrogen atom, the names are straight forward:

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab8.2.3 Nomenclature of Alkanes
Branched-chain alkanes are named according to the following rules.
1.  Locate the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms; this chain determines 
the parent name for the alkane. We designate the following compound as a hexane because the longest continuous chain contains six carbon atoms.
The longest continuous chain may not always be obvious from the way the formula is written. Notice, for example, that the following alkane is designated as a heptane because the longest chain contains seven carbon atoms.
2.Number the longest chain beginning from the end of the chain nearer the substituent. Applying this rule, we number the two alkanes shown above in the following way.
3 222 3|
3H C CH CH CH CH CH
CH7
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab3.Use the numbers obtained by the application of rule 2 to designate the 
location of the substituent group. The parent name is placed last, and the substituent group, preceded by the number designating its location on the chain, is placed first. Numbers are separated from words by a hyphen. The systematic names ot the two compounds shown above will then be:
4. When two or more substituents are present, give each substituent a number 
corresponding to its location on the longest chain. For example, we designate the following compound as 4 -ethyl-2 -methylhexane.
The substituent groups should be listed alphabetically (i.e. ethyl before methyl). 
In deciding on alphabetical order disregard multiplying prefixes such as “di” and “tri” .5.  When two substituents are present on the same carbon atom, use that 
     number twice.8
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab
6.When two or more substituents are identical, indicate this by the use of the 
prefixes di, tri , tetra , and so on. Then make certain that each and every substituent has a number. Commas are used to separate numbers from each other.
Application of these six rules allows us to name most of the alkanes that we shall encounter. Two other rules, however, may be required occasionally.
7.When two chains of equal length compete for selection as the parent chain, choose the chain with the greater number of substituents.9
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab
8. When branching first occurs at an equal distance from either end of the 
longest chain, choose the name that gives the lower number at the first point of 
difference.
8.2.4 Nomenclature of Alkenes:
The IUPAC rules for naming alkenes are similar in many respects to those for naming
 alkanes.
1.Select the longest continuous chain that contains the C = C as the parent 
chain. Change the ending of the name of the alkane of identical length from — ane to — ene, e.g.,
2.Number the chain so as to include both carbon atoms of the double bond. Numbering begins from the end nearer to the double bond.10
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab3.Designate the location of the double bond by using the number of the first 
atom of the double bond as a prefix.

4.Indicate the locations of the substituent groups by the numbers of the  carbon atoms to which they are attached.
5.If the parent chain contains more than one double bonds, they are alkadienes for two, alkatrienes for three and so on.

8.2.5 Nomenclature of Alkynes:
1.The largest continuous carbon chain containing triple bond is selected. The name of the identical alkane is changed from ane to — yne. e.g.

3H C C CH ≡

3.If a hydrocarbon contains more than one triple bonds, it is named as alkadiyne and triyne, etc. depending on the number of triple bonds.
4.If both double and triple bonds are present in the compound then ending 
enyne is given to the root.

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab8.3 ALKANES OR PARAFFINS
Alkanes are the simplest organic compounds made up of carbon and 
hydrogen only. They have a general formula of CnH2n+2. In these compounds 
the four valencies of carbon atoms are satisfied by single bonds to either other carbon atoms or hydrogen atom. They are, therefore known as Saturated Hydrocarbons. Methane (CH
4) is the simplest member of this family. Each 
carbon atom in alkane is sp3 hybridized and has a tetrahedral geometry.
8.3.1 General Methods of Preparations

The hydrogenation can also be carried out with platinum or

(3) Decarboxylation of Monocarboxylic Acids

When a concentrated solution of sodium or potassium salt of a mono 
carboxylic acid is electrolysed, an alkane is produced. This method is only suitable for the preparation of symmetrical alkanes i.e. those of the type R—R. Methane cannot be prepared by this method.

It is known to involve the following mechanism.When potassium salt of acetic acid is electrolysed, acetate ion migrates towards the anode gives up one electron to produce acetate free radical (CH
3COO), which decomposes to give a methyl free radical 
(CH3) and CO2.Two such methyl radicals combine to give ethane...

The carbonyl groups of aldehydes or ketones are reduced to methyl or 
methylene group respectively by either Clemmensen or Wolf-Kishner’s reduction. In the former reaction a ketone is reduced to an alkane using zinc amalgam and hydrochloric acid whereas in the later an aldehyde is reduced to alkane with hydrazine in the presence of KOH.

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab8.3.2. Physical Properties
1. Alkanes containing upto four carbon atoms are colourless, odourless gases 
while pentane to heptadecane (C5 to C17) are colourless, odourless liquids. The 
higher members from C18 onwards are waxy solids which are also colourless and 
odourless.
2. Alkanes are non-polar or very weakly polar and are insoluble in polar solvents
 like water, but soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene, ether, carbon tetra 
chloride,etc.
3. Their physical constants like boiling .points, melting points, density, etc increase 
with the increase in number of carbon atoms, whereas solubility decreases 
with increase in molecular mass. The boiling point increases by 20 to 30°C for addition of each CH
2 group to the molecule. The boiling points of alkanes 
having branched chain structures are lower than their isomeric normal chain alkanes, e.g. n-butane has a higher boiling point-0.5
0 C than isobutane (-1 1 .7°C).
4.The melting points of alkanes also increase with the increase in molecular mass     but this increase is not so regular.
8.3.3. Reactivity of Alkanes
The alkanes or paraffins (Latin: parum = little, affins = affinity) under ordinary condition are inert towards acids, alkalis, oxidizing and reducing agents. However, under suitable conditions, alkanes do undergo two types of reactions.1.
 Substitution R
eactions
2.
 T
hermal and Catalytic Reactions
These reactions take place at high temperature or on absorption of light energy through the formation of highly reactive free radicals.
The unreactivity of alkanes under normal conditions may be explained on the basis of the non-polarity of the bonds forming them. The eletronegativity values of carbon (2.5) and hydrogen (2.1) do not differ appreciably and the bonding electrons between C-H and C-C are equally shared making them almost non-polar. In view of this, the ionic reagents such as acids, alkalies, oxidizing agents, etc find no reaction site in the alkane molecules to which they could be attached.17
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.PunjabInertness of  s-bond
The unreactivity of alkanes can also be explained on the basis of inertness of a 
s-bond. In a s -bond the electrons are very tightly held between the nuclei which makes it a very stable bond. A lot of energy is required to break it. Moreover the electrons present in a s-bond can neither attack on any electrophile nor a 
nucleophile can attack on them. Both these facts make alkanes less reactive.
8.3.4 Reactions
1. Combustion 
Burning of an alkane in the presence of oxygen is known as Combustion.
Complete combustion of an alkane yields CO2, H2O and heat. 
The amount of heat evolved when one mole of a hydrocarbon is burnt to
 CO2 and H2O is called heat of combustion, e.g;
Although the reaction is highly exothermic, it requires very high temperature to initiate it, e.g. by a flame or a spark.( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) +   → + +Flame -1
42 22CH g   2O g   CO g   2H O g   891kJmol
Combustion is the major reaction occurring in the internal combustion engines of automobiles. A compressed mixture of alkanes and air burns smoothly in the internal combustion engine and increases its efficiency.
2. Oxidation
Oxidation of methane under different conditions gives different products. 
i) Incomplete oxidation occurs in a limited supply of oxygen 
or air and results in the formation of CO and carbon black.

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjabii) Catalytic Oxidation: Lower alkanes when burnt in the presence of metallic 
catalysts, at high temperature and pressure, result in the formation of useful
 products.
Catalytic oxidation of alkanes is used industrially to prepare higher fatty acids used in soap and vegetable oil industries.
3. Nitration:
It is a substitution reaction of alkanes in which a hydrogen atom of an alkane is replaced by nitro group (-NO
2). Alkanes undergo vapour-phase 
nitration under drastic condition (at 400-500°C) to give nitroalkanes, e.g.
Nitroalkanes generally find use as fuels, solvents, and in organic synthesis.[ ] oCu

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab4. Halogenation 
Alkanes react with chlorine and bromine in the presence of sunlight 
or UV light or at high temperature resulting in the successive replacement of hydrogen atoms with halogens called halogenation. Extent of halogenation depends upon the amount of halogen used.
Reaction of alkanes with fluorine is highly violent and results in 
a mixture of carbon, fluorinated alkanes and hydrofluoriq acid. Iodine does not substitute directly because the reaction is too slow and reversible. The order of reactivity of halogens is F
2>Cl2>Br2>I2.
Halogenation is believed to proceed through free radical mechanism. It involves the following three steps.
By repetition of step II, a mixture of halogen substituted products are obtained.The reaction is not synthetically so important.

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab8.3.5 Uses of Methane
Methane is used:
(i)      as a fuel and as an illuminating gas.
(ii)   for the preparation of methylchloride, dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.
(iii)  for the industrial preparation of methyl alcohol, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.(iv)  for the preparation of carbon black used in paints, printing  inks and automobile tyres.  (v)  is used to manufacture urea fertilizer.
8.4 ALKENES
Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms less than the coresponding saturated hydrocarbons. They are also known as Olefins (derived from Latin word olefiant meaning oil forming) because lower members form oily products on treatment with chlorine or bromine. The simplest olefin is C
2H4, ethene.
Alkene having one double bond are known as mono-enes with general formula C
nH2n. Alkenes containing two double bonds are called dienes.
8.4.1 General Methods of Preparation
1. Dehydrohalogenation of Alkyl Halides
Alkyl halides on heating with alcoholic potassium hydroxide undergo dehydrohalogenation i.e. elimination of a halogen atom together with a hydrogen atom from adjacent carbon atoms.22

occurs when dihalide is treated with Zinc dust in an anhydrous solvent like methanol or acetic acid.
4. Electrolysis of Salts of Dicarboxylic acid

5. Partial Hydrogenation of Alkynes: -
Controlled hydrogenation of alkynes with hydrogen gas in an equimolar ratio 
over heated catalysts, gives alkenes. The catalyst is finely divided palladium supported on BaSO
4 and poisoned by treatment with quinoline (Lindlar’s catalyst).
A trans alkene can be obtained by treating an alkyne with Na in liquid NH3 at -33°C.

2.  They are insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol.3.  They have characteristic smell and burn with luminous flame.4.   Unlike alkanes, they show weakly polar properties because of sp

           hybridization.25
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab8.4.3 Reactivity of a p-bond
In the formation of a p-bond, the partially filled p -orbitals overlap in a 
parallel fashion. The probability of finding electron is thus away from 
the line joining the two nuclei. Due to this reason p-electrons are less firmly held between the nuclei. A p-bond is, therefore, a weak bond as compared to a s-bond. During a reaction it breaks comparatively easily rendering alkenes as reactive group of compounds. Moreover, the loosely held p-electrons are more exposed to attack by the electrophilic reagents. Alkenes, therefore, undergo electrophilic reactions very easily.
8.4.4 Reactions of Alkenes
A. Addition Reactions 1. Addition of Hydrogen (Hydrogenation)
Hydrogenation is a process in which a molecule of hydrogen is added to an 
alkene in the presence of a catalyst and at moderate pressure (1-5 atm.) to give a saturated compound. The process is known as Catalytic Hydrogenation.
It is a highly exothermic process and the amount of heat evolved when one mole of an alkene is hydrogenated is called Heat of Hydrogenation. The heat of hydrogenation of most alkenes is about 120kJmole
-1 for each double bond 
present in a molecule. The catalysts employed are Pt, Pd and Raney nickel.
Raney Nickel
It is prepared by treating a Ni — Al alloy with caustic soda.
Most alkenes are hydrogenated over Raney nickel at about 100°C and upto 3-
atmosphere pressure. → +2 223

8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.PunjabCatalytic hydrogenation of alkenes is used in the laboratory as well as 
in industry. In industry, it is used for the manufacture of vegetable ghee from vegetable oils. In the laboratory, it is used as a synthetic method as well as an analytical tool, as the reaction is generally quantitative.
2. Addition of Hydrogen Halides
Alkenes react with dry gaseous hydrogen halides to form alkyl halides. The order of reactivity of halogen aicds is HI > HBr > HC1.

|H C=CH + HCl H C CH

The addition of a hydrogen halide to an alkene takes place in two steps.Alkene accepts the proton of hydrogen halide to form a carbocation.27
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.PunjabThe carbocation then reacts with the halide ion.
The addition of hydrogen halide over an unsymmetrical alkene is governed by 
Markownikov’s Rule. The rule states that; in the addition of an unsymmetrical reagent to an unsymmetrical alkene, the negative part of the adding reagent goes to that carbon, constituting the double bond, which has least number of hydrogen atoms.28
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab3. Addition of Sulphuric Acid
When alkenes are treated with cold concentrated sulphuric acid, they are 
dissolved because they react by addition to form alkyl hydrogen sulphate. For example,
These alkylhydrogen sulphates on boiling with water decompose to give corresponding alcohols. The overall reaction involves the addition of water to an alkene and it is, therefore, called hydration reaction.

4. Addition of Halogens
The alkenes on treatment with halogen in an inert solvent like carbon tetrachloride 
at room temperature give vicinal dihalides or 1,2 dihalogenated products. For example,
Br2 and Cl2 are effective electrophilic reagents. Fluorine is too reactive to control 
the reaction. Iodine does not react.
Mechanism:
a.   A bromine molecule becomes polarized as it approaches the alkene. This 
polarized bromine molecule transfers a positive bromine atom to the alkene 
resulting in the formation of a bromonium ion.29

ion to form vic. dibromide and the colour of bromine is discharged. A trans

B. OXIDATION REACTIONS
1. Addition of Oxygen
Alkenes when mixed with oxygen or air and passed over a silver oxide 
catalyst at high temperature and pressure, add an atom of oxygen to form epoxides. Epoxides serve as the starting substances for the industrial production of glycols.30
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.Punjab2. Hydroxylation
When alkenes are treated with mild oxidizing reagents like dilute 
(1%) alkaline KMn04 solution (Baeyer's Reagent) at low temperature, 
hydroxylation of duoubie bond occurs resulting in the formation of dihydroxy compounds known as vicinal glycols. The pink colour of KMnO
4 
solution is discharged during the reaction. It is also a test for the presence of unsaturation in the molecules. For example,
3. Combustion
Alkenes burn in air with luminous flame and produce CO
2 and H2O 
vapours. Ethene forms a highly explosive mixture with air or oxygen.

4. Ozonolysis
Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive allotropic form of oxygen. It reacts vigorously 
with alkenes to form unstable molozonide. It rearranges spontaneously to 
form an ozonide.31
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.PunjabOzonides are unstable compounds and are reduced directly by treatment with zinc 
and H2O. The reduction produces carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones).

Ozonolysis is used to locate the position of double bond in an alkene.
C. Polymerization
In this ‘process small organic molecules (monomers) combine together to form 
larger molecules known as Polymers.Ethene at 400°C and 100 atm pressure, polymerize to polythene or polyethylene.
A good quality polythene is obtained, when ethene is polymerized in the presence of aluminium triethyl Al(C
2H5)3 and titanium tetrachloride catalysts 
(TiCl4).

8.5 ALKYNES
Unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain a triple bond are called Alkynes. They have the general molecular formula C
nH2n-2 and contain two hydrogen
atoms less than the corresponding alkenes.
8.5.1 General Methods of Preparation
1. Dehydrohalogenation of Vicinal Dihalides
Vicinal dihalide on treatment with a strong base eliminates two mole -
cules of hydrogen halides from two adjacent carbons to give an alkyne.The first member of the Alkyne series has the formula C2H2 and is known as 
Ethyne or Acetylene.

he first three members are gases (ethyne, propyne, butyne) at room 
temperature, The next eight members (C5 - C12) are liquids and higher     
members are solids.
3 The melting points, boiling points and densities increase gradually with                     
the increase in molecular masses.4 They are nonpolar and dissolve readily in solvents like ether, benzene and carbon tetrachloride.
8.5.3 Reactivity of Alkynes
In alkynes, the carbon atoms are held together by a triple bond, a s-bond and two p-bonds. The electron density between the carbon atoms is very high 
which draws atoms very close to each other. Electrons in a triple bond are, therefore, less exposed and thus less reactive towards electrophilic reagents.
8.5.4 Reactions
A. Addition Reactions:
Alkynes undergo addition reactions like alkenes but add two molecules of the 
reagent instead of one.
1. Addition of Hydrogen:
Alkynes react with hydrogen gas in the presence of a suitable catalysts 
like finely divided Ni, Pt, or Pd. Initially alkenes are formed which then take up another molecule of hydrogen to form an alkane.36

D.  Acidic Nature of Alkynes
In ethyne and other terminal alkynes like propyne, the hydrogen atom is bonded to the carbon atom with sp-s overlap. An sp hybrid orbital has 50% s-character in it and renders the carbon atom more electronegative than sp
2 and sp3 hybridized carbons. As a result, the sp hybridized 
carbon atom of a terminal alkyne pulls the electrons more strongly making the attached hydrogen atom slightly acidic.

8.5.6 Comparison of Reactivities of Alkanes, Alkenes and Alkynes
The general decreasing reactivity order of alkanes, alkenes and alkynes is as 
follows:
Alkenes > Alkynes > Alkanes42
8. ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS eLearn.PunjabAlkynes although contain two p-bonds are less reactive than alkenes 
towards electrophilic reagents. This is because the bond distance between 
the two triple bonded carbon atoms is very short and hence the p
-electrons are not available to be attacked by electrophilic reagents.Alkynes are, however, more reactive than alkenes towards nucleophilic reagents.

he decreasing reactivity order of alkanes, alkenes and alkynes are as 
follows:
Alkenes > Alkynes > AlkanesIt has already been explained that a p-bond in alkenes is not only weak 
but its electrons are more exposed to an attack by an electrophilic reagent. Both these facts make the alkenes a very reactive class of compounds.
