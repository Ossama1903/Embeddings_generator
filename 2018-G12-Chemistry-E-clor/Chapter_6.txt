cause they are located between the s and p-block elements and their 
properties are in transition between the metallic elements of the s-block and nonmetallic elements of the p-block.The electronic con-figurations of three series of d-block elements are given in Table 6.1.4
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabThey are transition elements by definition, as there is one electron in the 
d-subshell of each atom. In compounds they mostly occur as the tripositive ions, having no d-electron (the atom having lost its only one d-electron), hence they do not exhibit properties of transition elements and behave like main group elements.6.1.1   Typical And Non-Typical Transition Elements
Group IIB elements (Zn, Cd and Hg) do not have a partially filled d-subshell either as elements or in any of their ionic state. Neither do they show typical properties of transition elements to any appreciable extent (except complex formation). Similarly, IIIB (Sc, Y and La) is another group of elements which do not show many of the properties associated with typical transition elements. 
In order to maintain a rational classification, the elements of group IIBand group IIIB are referred to as non-typical transition elements and the elements in the remaining transition series are called typical transition elements, Table 6.3.
We treat the coinage metals Cu, Ag and Au as transition metals, since 
Cu
2+ has a 3d9 configuration, Ag2+a 4d9 and Au3+ a 5d8configuration.
f- Block elements i.e. Lanthanides and Actinides are also called inner transition metals, whereas d-block elements are called outer transition metals.The detailed electronic configurations of the valence shell of the first transition series is shown in Table 6.2. You will notice that in chromi-um one electron from s-subshell has been used to half fill d-subshell. Similarly, in copper, one electron from s-subshell has gone to d-sub -
shell to fill it completely. This appears to be due to a certain mea-
sure of stability associated with a half-filled d
5 shell and a full d10 shell.5

6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab6.2 PROPERTIES OF TRANSITION ELEMENTS
Because of a similar electronic configuration, the d-block elements 
closely resemble one another in their physical and chemical properties. 
Some of the points of their resemblance are given below.1.

6.2.1 General charactetistics
(a) Binding energies
Transition metals show good mechanical properties. They are tough, 
malleable and ductile. The toughness of these metals indicate strong metallic binding. This is because, apart from s-electrons of the outer most shell, the electrons of underlying half-filled d-orbitals also participate in binding.
In moving from left to right in any transition series, the number of unpaired 
electrons increases up to groups VB and VIB, after that pairing takes place and number of unpaired electrons goes on decreasing until it becomes zero at group IIB, Table 6.37
6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab
Therefore, binding is stronger upto group VIB and weakens progressively 
upto group IIB. This trend of variation in binding energies is shown in Fig. 6.1. In the first transition series the general increase in binding energy ends at vanadium. This is due to changes in metallic structure, e.g. Mn. In the third transition series, the increase in binding energy ends at tungsten when all the 5d electrons contribute to binding.
Fig. 6.1 Binding energies of the elements of the first and third 
transition series
(b) Melting and Boiling Points
Transition metals have very high melting and boiling points due to strong bind-
ing forces present between their atoms. Melting points increase up to the middle of the series and then decrease to a minimum level at the end of the series.This trend in melting points  correlates well with the strength of binding  forces as is clear from the Figs. 6.1 and 6.2.8

6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab(c) Covalent Radii and Ionic Radii
The covalent radii decrease rapidly at the start of the series, then 
become almost constant and finally begin to increase at the end of the series. The increase in covalent radii is possibly due to the fact that the filled 3d orbitals have contracted into the electron core and so shield the outer 4s electrons more effectively from the nucleus, Fig. 6.3.
Fig. 6.3 Covalent radii (—   } and ionic radii (for M2+) (—   ) of first 
transition series elements.Changes in the ionic radii along the series are much less regular, so that periodic trends in the properties of these ions are difficult to rationalize.
(d) Paramagnetism
Substances which are weakly attracted by a strong magnetic field are 
called paramagnetic substances.Those substances which- are weakly 
repelled by a strong magnetic field are called diamagnetic substances.10
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabParamagnetic behaviour is caused by the presence of unpaired electrons in 
an atom, molecule or ion because there is a magnetic moment associated withthe spinning electron. It increases with increase in the number of unpaired electrons.

Table 6.4 No. of Unpaired electrons in the First Series of Transition
 Elements.11
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabThe paramagnetic behaviour is the strongest for Fe3+ and Mn2+ and 
decreases on both sides of the first transition series. The reason is 
that both Mn2+ and Fe3+ have 5 unpaired electrons each. The number 
of unpaired electrons decreases gradually to zero on both sides, as it is clear from the Table 6.4. Fig.6.4 shows the variation in the paramagnetic effect of the ions belonging to the first transition series.
Fig 6.4 Variation in the paramagnetic effect shown by the 
selected ions across the first transition series
(e ) Oxidation State
One of the most important properties of the transition elements is the 
fact that they exhibit variable valency or oxidation state. They show variable valencies because of the involvement of the unpaired d elec -
trons in addition to s electrons in bond formation. All 3d series ele -
ments show an oxidation state of +2 in addition to higher oxidation states.12
6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab+2 oxidation state is shown when only the 2s electrons are involved
 in bonding. In the highest oxidation states of the first five elements all the s and d electrons are used for bonding. After Mn, the number of oxidation states decreases as the d-subshells fill up and fewer un-paired electrons are available for bond formation as shown in Table 6.5.

Series of Transition Elments
In transition elements, the d orbitals are responsible for the colour develop -
ment in their compounds. When these orbitals are involved in bonding, they split up into two energy levels, one set has a higher energy than the oth-er. The electrons residing in low energy d-orbitals absorb a part of the visible light and jump to high energy d orbitals. The process is called d-d transition,(f) Colour13
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabFig. 6.5. The energy difference of d-orbitals varies from ion to ion. 
Thus, every ion absorbs a different wavelength and transmits the re -
maining set of wavelengths that gives different colours to the ions.    
Fig. 6.5 Absorption of yellow light by [Ti(H2O)6]3+ ion.
In [Ti(H2O)6]3+, yellow light is absorbed, while most of the blue and red 
lights are transmitted, therefore the solution of [Ti(H20)6]3+ ions looks violet
 in colour.
(g) Interstitial Compounds
When small non-metal atoms like H, B, C, N enter the interstices of transition 
metals and impart useful features to them, they are called Interstitial compounds .These are non-stoichiometric compounds.Sometime they are 
also termed as interstitial alloys.
(h) Alloy Formation
Owing to the similarity in their sizes, some transition metal atoms 
are able to replace one another in the metallic lattice and form substitutional alloys among themselves. Alloy steels are an important example of this type of material in which iron atoms are substituted by chromium, manganese and nickel atoms, etc. to give the steel more useful properties. Other examples are brass, bronze, coinage alloys, etc.14
6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab6.3 COMPLEX COMPOUNDS
It has been observed that when the aqueous solutions of Fe (CN)2 and 
KCN are mixed together and evaporated a new compound is obtained, which
in aqueous solution does not ionize as Fe2+ and CN ions but ionizes as K+ ion and
[Fe (CN)6]4- ion (Ferrocyanide ion). On this basis it has been given a formula
 K4 [Fe (CN)6].
Here [Fe (CN)6]-4 is called a complex ion.
Such compounds containing the complex molecules or complex ions and capable of independent existence are called coordination compounds or complexes.
A complex compound may contain

tion and a complex anion

6.3.1 Components of Complex Compounds
It is necessary to understand different terms used in the study of the complex compounds.These are as follows:
(a) Central Metal Ion
A metal atom or ion (usually a transition element) surrounded by a number 
of ligands is called a central metal atom or ion, e.g. K
4 [Fe(CN)6], [Ag(NH3)2]Cl
In the above examples, Fe2+ and Ag1+ are the central metal ions, respectively.
(b) Ligand
The atoms or ions or neutral molecules, which surround the central metalion and donate electron pairs to it,are called ligands.They may be anions or neutral molecules, e.g.   K
4 [Fe(CN)6], [Ag(NH3)2]Cl.15
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabIn the above examples, CN- and NH3 are the anionic and neutral ligands, 
respectively. Ligands having two donor atoms are called bidentate ligands, e.g.
                        COO-
Oxalate ion |         is a bidentate ligand and its coordination with the metal 
                      COO- 
ion occur through its both negatively charged oxygen atoms.
(c) Coordination Number
The number of lone pair of electrons provided by the ligands to the central metal atom or ion is called the coordination number of the central metal atom or ion, e.g.
K
4 [Fe(CN)6]   ,   [Cu(NH3)4]SO4
In the above examples, coordination number of iron is 6 and that of copper is 4.
(d) Coordination Sphere
The central metal atom or ion alongwith ligands is called the coordination sphere.It is usually placed in square brackets. It may be anionic, cationic or neutral, e.g.
K4 [Fe(CN)6]   ,   [Cu(NH3)4]SO4   ,   [Ni(CO)4]
In the above examples, [Fe(CN)6]4- , [Cu(NH3)4]2+   and   [Ni(CO)4]0 are anionic, 
cationic and neutral coordination spheres, respectively.

6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab6.3.2 Chelates
When all the donor atoms of a polydentate ligand get coordinated 
with the same metal ion, a complex compound is formed which contains one or more rings in its structure and hence is called a Chelate . Metal chelates are more stable metal complexes.
When two oxalato ligands C
2O42- (bidentate ligand) get coordinated 
with Pt2+ ion, dioxalato platinate (II) ion is obtained. Each 
oxalate ligand forms a five membered ring with the cation.
(e) Charge on the Coordination Sphere
It is the algebric sum of the charges present on the central metal ion and the total charge on the ligands, e.g;
                                                                      [Fe(CN)
6]4-
 Charge on iron                                              = + 2
Total charge on six CN- ions                       = - 6
              Charge on the coordination sphere         = -6 + 2 = - 417

6.3.3 Nomenclature
The nomenclature of complex compounds is based upon the 
recommendations by the Inorganic Nomenclature Committee of IUPAC.The rules for naming the complex compounds are as follows.1.
 C
ations are named before anions.
2.
 I
n naming the coordination sphere, ligands are named in alphabetical order 
regradless of the nature and number of each, followed by the name of central metal ion.
3.
 T
he prefixes di, tri, tetra, penta, hexa, etc, are used to specify the number of 
coordinated ligands.
4.
 T
he names of anionic ligands end in suffix O, e.g, hydroxo, (OH-) carbonato 
(CO32-).
5.
 T
he names of neutral ligands are usually unchanged, e.g. for NH3, ammine 
and for H2O, aqua. and for CO, carbonyl.
6.
 T
he suffix  ‘ate’ comes at the end of the name of metal if the complex 
represents an anion, otherwise it remains unchanged.
7.
 T
he oxidation number of the metal ion is represented by a Roman numeral 
in parenthesis following the name of the metal.18

Source and credit:Oscar6.3.4 Geometry of Complexes
The geometry of complexes depend upon the type of hybridization taking place 
in the valence shell of the central metal atom.
In writing the formula of a complex ion, the usual practice is to place the symbol of the central metal atom first, followed by the formulas of the anionic ligands in alphabatical order, then neutral ligands in alphabatic order and the formula of the whole complex ion is enclosed in square brackets as is clear from the above examples.19
6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab6.4.2 Wrought Iron
Composition
It is the purest form of commercial iron and contains the lowest 
percentage of carbon and upto 0.3% of impurities like S,P ,Si and Mn, etc.
S = 0.2 to 0.15%, Mn = upto 0.25 %, P = 0.04 to 0.2%6.4 IRON
The important ores of iron are magnetite (Fe3O4), haematite (Fe2O3)and 
limonite Fe2O3.3H2O etc. Iron has been known since prehistoric days. It was 
used in Egypt in 1500 B.C. It is known that the Chinese also used iron as early as 2500 B.C. In the subcontinent, iron was produced around 600B.C.
6.4.1 Commercial Forms of Iron
Iron is available commercially in the following three forms.
They differ in carbon contents as follows:
1.
 P
ig iron or cast iron            2.5 to 4.5% carbon
2.
 W
rought iron                      0.12 to 0.25% carbon
3.
 S
teel                                     0.25 to 2.5% carbon
6.4.3 Manufacture of Wroughtlron from Cast Iron
It is manufactured from cast iron by puddling i.e. by heating cast iron in a 
special type of reverberatory furnace called puddling furnace, Fig. 6.6 . This funance has a low roof to deflect the hot gases and flames downwards and to melt cast iron. The hearth of the furnace is lined with haematite (Fe
2O3). The cast iron is placed on the hearth, melted by hot gases and 
stirred or puddled with long iron rods called rabbles through the doors to bring it in thorough contact with the lining of the hearth, i.e.Fe
2O320
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabThe haematite (Fe2O3) lining supplies oxygen, necessary for the oxidation of 
carbon, sulphur, silicon, manganese and phosphorus present in the cast iron. 
Oxides of carbon and sulphur, being volatile escape out at high temperature.

With the removal of impurities, the melting point of the metal rises 
and it becomes a semi-solid mass. At this stage, it is taken out in the form of balls or blooms on the ends of rabbles. While still hot, these balls are subjected to hammering to squeeze out, as much of slag as possible. The product so obtained is known as wrought iron.
6.4.4 Steel
Steel is an alloy of iron containing 0.25 to 2.5% of carbon and traces of S, P , Si and Mn.
Classification of Steel
1. Mild Steel (0.1 - 0.2 % C)
It is fairly soft, malleable and ductile, can be forged (shaped by hammering 
and pressing while hot). It is used in making tubes, nuts, bolts, bars and boilerplates.
2. Medium Carbon Steel (0.2 - 0.7 % C)It is harder than mild steel. It is also malleable and ductile. It is used in making rails, axles, castings.
3. High Carbon Steel(0.7 -1.5 % C)
It is hard and can be forged, when containing less than 1.0% carbon. Steel containing more than 1.0% carbon cannot be forged. It is used to make hammers, taps, dies, cutting tools, machine tools, hard steel parts of machinery and all sort of engines.
Steel is intermediate in carbon content between 
cast iron and wrought iron. It can be produced from:(i)     Cast iron by removing some carbon alongwith sulphur, phosphorus and silicon.(ii)
   B
y adding the required amount of carbon to wrought iron, then 
adding some special constituents, e.g. tungsten, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, manganese, nickel and cobalt which impart desired properties to the steel. At present most of the steel is manufactured from cast iron.22
6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab6.4.5 Manufacture of Steel.
In can be manufactured by the following processes.
1.
 Open hear
th process ( using cast iron, wrought iron or steel scrap)
2.
 B
essemer’s process (using cast iron only)
Some other processes are also used to prepare special type of steel from pure wrought iron.
6.4.6 Open Hearth Process
This is the most modern method for the manufacture of steel. It is carried out in an open hearth furnace. This furnace has a low roof to deflect the hot gases and flames downward to melt the charge. The open hearth furnance works on the regenerative principle of heat economy Fig.6.7. 
Open hearth process is of two types.
1.
 F
urnace with acidic lining like SiO2 is used when the impurities are Mn, 
Si,etc.
2.
 F
urnace with basic lining like dolomite (CaO, MgO ) is used when the 
impurities are P and S, etc.
Fig. 6.7 Open Hearth furnace for the manufacture of steel from cast iron23
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabProcess
A mixture of cast iron, scrap steel and quick lime is charged into the furnace.
At about 1600°C Si, Mn, C, S, and P are burnt out and removed according to the following reactions.
CO escapes in the flue gases. Silica (SiO
2) combines with CaO, MnO and 
FeO to form silicates (slag) which float on the surface of the molten metal.12 2 C O CO+  →

6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabSamples are taken at intervals and the percentage of carbon in the 
steel is determined regularly. When this is reduced to about 0.1%, the calculated weight of ferromanganese (Fe, Mn, C) is added. Manganese desulphurises the steel. Carbon raises the carbon contents to the required values. After giving time for mixing, a little more ferromanganese is added and the charge is allowed to run into moulds where it solidifies to ingots
The whole process takes about 10 hours. Slag contains calcium 
phosphate. It is ground to powder and sold as a fertilizer.
6.4.7 Bessemer's Process 
The furnace used in this process is called Bessemer's Converter which is 
a pear shaped vessel made of steel plates. At the bottom the converter is provided with a number of holes through which hot air can be introduced. The converter is held on a central axis so that it can be tilted in any desired position for feeding and pouring out the finshed materials, Fig.6.8.
Molten pig or cast iron (25 to 30 tons) from the blast furnace is fed into the converter and hot air blast is injected through the perforated base. This oxidizes carbon, silicon, and manganese.

Within 10 to 15 minutes the flame due to CO subsides indicating that the 
carbon is completely oxidized. At this stage ferromanganese is added to correct the proportion of carbon to obtain the desired qualities. A blast of air is continued for a moment to ensure thorough mixing. The addition of Mn imparts increased hardness and tensile strength.CO produced burns at the mouth of the converter with a blue flame. Iron is partly oxidized to ferric oxide (Fe
2O3) which also extracts carbon 
from cast iron to form CO.26

holes), such as O2, N2, CO2, a little aluminum or ferro-
silicon is also added. Aluminum removes nitrogen as nitride.
At the end of the operation , the molten steel is poured out into mouldes for casting. Such casting are free from any defect.
6.5 CORROSION
Any process of chemical decay of metals due to the action of surrounding medium is called corrosion.
The simplest case of corrosion occurs when metals come into contact 
with gases of the atmosphere. The surface of metals becomes coated with compounds such as oxides, sulphides and carbonates. Such compounds sometime form a compact layer on the surface protecting the metal from further attack.
The case would be different when the metal is in contact with water. The compounds formed in this case may dissolve in water, allowing the corrosion to penetrate further into the metal. Besides dissolving the compounds, water also promotes electrochemical process which is one of the main causes of rapid corrosion.
6.5.1 Electrochemical TheoryPure metals are not easily corroded, even iron hardly gets corroded if absolutely pure. The impurities present in the metal promote corrosion.To understand why impurities accelerate the corrosion of metals, consider what happens when two different metals come in contact with one another in moist air. Suppose, for instance, Cu is brought in contact with Al. After sometime, we will notice that aluminium gets corroded while copper remains intact. This can be explained by the electrochemical theory.According to this theory, moisture and CO
2 are present on the 
surface of the metal. Water ionizes into H+ and OH- ions. CO2 
dissolves in water forming H2CO3 which ionizes as follows:27
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabCopper and aluminium are, in a sense, immersed in the solution containing 
H+, OH- and HCO-
3  ions. This forms a galvanic cell in which aluminium 
releases electrons and changes to Al3+ ion (being more reactive- than Cu) 
i.e it acts as positive electrode and Cu acts as a negative electrode, Fig.6.9.23 3 H CO H HCO+−+ ���� ��
Fig.6.9 Diagram of the corrosion of aluminium in contact with copper3
Aluminium ions attract OH- ion to form, Al (OH)3 i.e it starts 
dissolving. The H+ ions present on the Cu receive the electrons 
and released as H2. In this way, aluminium corrodes rapidly when 
in contact with copper which is lower in electrochemical series.From this, we can conclude that when an active metal Al (higher in the electrochemical series) comes in contact with less active metal Cu (lower in the electrochemical series) a galvanic cell is established. In this process active metal corrodes rapidly, while the other remains intact.28
6. Transition Elements eLearn.Punjab6.5.2 Prevention from Corrosion
It has been observed that the amount of iron destroyed each year by 
corrosion equals to about one fourth of its annual production. It is therefore necessary to prevent such a damaging process and avoid this loss.Different methods are used to prevent corrosion. The simplest of them consists of protecting the surface of the metal from coming in direct contact with the surrounding by coating it with oil, paint, varnish or enamel. It can also be prevented by alloying the metals or by coating the metal with a thin layer of another metal.
6.5.3 Tin Plating or Coating Iron with Tin (cathode coating)
The process of tin plating consists of dipping the clean sheet of iron in a bath of molten tin and then passing it through hot pair of rollers. Such plates are used in the manufacture of tin canes, oil containers and other similar articles.Tin itself is very stable and protects the metals effectively as long as its coating on the iron is intact.
If the protective coating is damaged, then iron comes into contact with 
moisture. A galvanic cell is established in which tin acts as a cathode and iron as an anode. The electron’s flow from iron to tin, where they discharge H
+ ions, leaving behind OH- in the solution. These hydroxide 
ions react with iron forming Fe(OH)3, which dissolves rapidly in water. 
From this, it can be concluded that plated iron gets rust more rapidly when the protective coating is damaged than the non-plated iron.
6.5.4 Galvanizing or Zinc Coating (anode coating)
Galvanizing is done by dipping a clean iron sheet in a zinc chloride bath and 
heating. The iron sheet is then removed, rolled into zinc bath and air cooled.In this case, if a protective layer of zinc is damaged a galvanic cell is established in the presence of moisture. Iron serves as a cathode and zinc as an anode. Electrons flow from zinc to iron, as a result of which Zn decays while Fe remains intact. This is called sacrificial corrosion.29
6. Transition Elements eLearn.PunjabThis is the way galvanizing helps protecting iron from rust. This process is used 
in water pipes, etc.22Fe Zn Zn Fe+++  → +
6.6 CHROMATES AND DICHROMATES
Chromates and dichromates are the salts of chromic acid, H2CrO4  , and 
dichromic acid, H2Cr2O7 respectively. Both acids exist only in aqueous 
solution and when attempts are made to isolate them from solution they decompose immediately into chromic anhydride (CrO
3) and water. 
Their salts are, however, quite stable.
6.6.1 Potassium Chromate (K2CrO4)
Preparation1.
 T
he chromates of alkali metals, which are soluble in water, are obtained 
by oxidizing trivalent chromium compounds in the presence of an alkali.
3. Chromates are usually prepared from natural chromite (FeO.Cr
2O3), if the latter is strongly heated with potassium carbonate 
in the presence of the oxygen. The resulting fused mass will contain potassium chromate, which can be extracted with water.2. Chromates can also be produced by fusing Cr
2O3 with an 
alkali in the presence of an oxidant, such as potassium chlorate.

6.6.2 Properties
Structure of Chromate Ion
Almost all the chromates are yellow in colour. 
Some of them are used as pigments. For instance, insoluble lead chromate, PbCrO
4, is employed for 
the preparation of yellow oil colour called yellow crown.K
2CrO4 and K2Cr2O7 show similar properties, 
because in an aqueous solution Cr2O72- and CrO42- 
ions exist in equilibrium.
22

If an alkali is added to such a solution the hydroxyl ions will bind the hydrogen ion in solution, the equilibrium will shift towards left and, as a result, dichromate ions will be converted into chromate ions. Similarly on adding an acid the equilibrium will shift towards right and dichromate ions willbe formed.
6.6.3 Potassium Dichromate (K2Cr2O7)
Preparation
1. K2CrO4 is converted to K2Cr2O7 by using the above mentioned

The purple solution of KMnO4, obtained as above is filtered 
through asbestos, concentrated and allowed to crystallize 
when KMnO4 deposits as deep purple-red rhombic prisms.In this process, manganate is converted to permanganate by electrolytic oxidation. During electrolysis of an aqueous solution of K
2MnO4, water is decomposed to evolve hydrogen gas at the cathode 
and oxygen gas at the anode.Oxygen liberated at the anode oxidizes manganate ion (MnO
4)2- into permanganate ion (MnO4)1-, while hydrogen
 is liberated at the cathode.The fused K2MnO4 obtained as above is extracted with water and the solution, 
after filtration, is converted into potassium permanganate (KMnO4) by 
any of the following methods.34
