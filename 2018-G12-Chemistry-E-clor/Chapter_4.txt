Elements3
Group VA and VIA Elements eLearn.PunjabNitrogen and phosphorus of group VA show the typical properties of non-metals. 
For example, they are poor conductors of heat and electricity and give acidic oxides. Their compounds are predominantly covalent. Arsenic and antimony are metalloids. However bismuth at the bottom of the group shows definite metallic properties. The metallic character increases going down the group. Nitrogen has the greatest tendency to attract the electrons, antimony and bismuth have the least. The trend down the group also shifts from covalent bonding to ionic bonding.Phosphorus, arsenic and antimony have allotropes. 4.1.1 General Characteristics
Phosphorus and other members of the group can make use of d orbitals in their bonding. This is because the energy of these orbitals is not much greater than those of the other valence shell orbitals. For example, phosphorus can make use of its 3s, 3p and the empty 3d orbitals during bonding with otherelements.In phosphorus one of the 3s electrons can be promoted to a vacant 3d orbital giving 5 unpaired electrons in the valence shell. Phosphorus can thus make three or five covalent bonds. Indeed three and five are the common valencies of the group VA elements.

4.2  NITROGEN AND ITS COMPOUNDS
4.2.1  Occurrence
Nitrogen is present in free state in air as a major constituent (78% by volume). It is an inactive gas in comparison with oxygen which is the next major constituent of air. Inorganic compounds of nitrogen are not commonly found as minerals.
In combined state nitrogen is found in all 
living matter including, animals and plants in the form of proteins, urea and amino acids.4
Group VA and VIA Elements eLearn.Punjab4.2.2     Oxides of Nitrogen
Nitrogen forms several oxides with oxygen. Common oxides of nitrogen are N2O, 
NO and NO2. It also forms N2O3 and N2O5.
1. Dinitr ogen Oxide (N2O)
Preparation
1.Dinitrogen oxide can be prepared by the action of dil, HNO, on metallic zinc.
Fig. 4.1 Oxides of Nitrogen)fg
N5
Group VA and VIA Elements eLearn.Punjab2. It is usually prepared by heating ammonium nitrate to about 200°C .
To avoid the danger of explosion, ammonium nitrate can be 
replaced by a mixture of sodium nitrate and ammonium sulphate.
Properties of Dinitrogen Oxide
Dinitrogen oxide is a colourless gas with a faint, pleasant smell and a sweetish  taste. It is fairly soluble in cold water. Its mixture with a little oxygen, if inhaled for a sufficiently long time, produces hysterical laughter, hence it is also known as “laughing gas” .
Reactions
1. I t is not combustible but resembles oxygen in rekindling a glowing 
splinter. Similarly, it supports combustion if burning substances, such as sulphur, phosphorus, etc. are taken in the cylinder containing this gas.2 32 2 2 4 ( ) 10 ( .) 4 ( ) ( ) ( ) 5H O( )Zn s HNO dil Zn NO aq N O g l+ → ++

Group VA and VIA Elements eLearn.PunjabProperties of Nitrogen Dioxide
Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish brown gas with a pungent smell. It dissolves 
readily in water to form a blue acidic solution.
Reactions
1. On cooling, NO2 is converted into a yellow liquid which can be frozen to a 
colourless solid dinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4). If this solid is heated to 140°C, the 
mixture contains NO2 and N2O4 but above 140°C NO2 is converted to NO and 
O2 molecules which are colourless. This decomposition is complete at 620°C.
2.Elements like phosphorus, potassium and carbon continue burning in NO2 as 
it yields O2 on decomposition.

4.3     PHOSPHORUS AND ITS COMPOUNDS
4.3.1     Occurrence
Phosphorus is the second member of group VA. Its name comes 
from Greek word meaning “Light bearing” . Unlike, nitrogen it does not occur in free state in nature. Most of the phosphorus is found in deposits of phosphate rock, i.e.impure Ca
3(PO4)2 and apatite Ca5F (PO4)3.
As a constituent of plant and animal tissues, it is essential for their normal growth. It occurs especially in seeds, the yolk of eggs, the nerves, brain and bone marrows, usually in the form of lecithins. In the form of calcium phosphate, it is an essential constituent of bones. Bone ash (80% calcium phosphate) is an important source of phosphorus.
4.3.2     Allotropes of Phosphorus
Phosphorus can exist in at least six different solid allotropic forms, of which we will mention only three.
White phosphorus is a very reactive, poisonous, volatile, waxy, yellowish 
white substance, which is soluble in benzene and carbon disulphide. It exists in the form of tetraatomic molecules (P
4) which have a tetrahedral 
structure, Fig. 4.3. It boils at 280°C to P4 vapours which dissociate above 700°C 
to form P2 molecules.20

Fig. 4.4 Red phosphorusFig.4.3 White phosphorus
Black phosphorus is the third form which is most stable under ordinary 
conditions. Black phosphorus is prepared by heating red phosphorus to high temperature and pressure.
4.3.3    Halides of Phosphorus
1.          Phosphorus Trichloride (PCl3)
Preparation
1. I t is usually prepared by melting white phosporus in a retort in an inert 
atmosphere of CO2 and current of dried chlorine is passed over it. The vapours 
of PCl3 are collected in a flask kept in an ice-bath.

4.4.1      General Characteristics
All the elements of group VIA are non-metals except Po which is a 
radioactive metal. Atomic radii, density, melting and boiling points generally increase with increase in atomic number down the group. Ionization energies of the group members are very high which shows their reluctance to lose electrons. Oxygen is the most electronegative element after fluorine. All these elements show the property of allotropy.28
Group VA and VIA Elements eLearn.PunjabOxygen has two allotropic forms (O2 and O3), sulphur has 3(α, β, γ), Se has 
two (red and grey) ,Te has two (metallic and non-metallic). They also show 
the property of catenation. This property decreases down the group. All the elements are polymeric in nature ( they form poiy-atomic molecules). They attain the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas by gaining 2 electrons forming O
-2, S-2, Se-2, etc. Except oxygen the other members of 
the group show a covalency of +2 ,+4, and +6, for example, SCl2, SCl4, SCl6. 
+2 oxidation state is shown due to 2 unpaired electrons in the p-orbitals. +4 oxidation state is shown when 1 electron from p-orbilal is promoted to the next vacant d-orbital, while + 6 oxidation state is shown when another electron from s-orbital is also promoted to the next vacant d-orbital.
4.4.2   Occurrence
Oxygen is the most widely distributed and common of all the elements, comprising about 50% of the earth’s crust.About one-fourth of the atmospheric air by weight consists of free oxygen and water contains nearly 89% of combined oxygen. The calcium carbonate which occurs as chalk, limestone, marble etc, contains 48% oxygen. Silica which is found in flint, quartz, etc, contains more than 53% oxygen by weight.
Sulphur is also widely distributed in nature both as free and in combined forms. Many important metallic ores are sulphides, e.g, galena (PbS), 
Zinc blende (ZnS), cinnabar (HgS), stibnite (Sb
2S3), copper pyrite 
(Cu2S.Fe2S3), iron pyrite (FeS2), etc. Some important sulphates are 
also found in nature, e.g. gypsum (CaSO4), heavy spar (BaSO4), 
etc.
Sulphur also occurs in organic compounds present in animals and vegetables. Onions, garlic, mustard, hair, many oils, eggs and proteins consist of compounds containing sulphur in them . It also occurs as a constituent of coal and petroleum .

Group VA and VIA Elements eLearn.Punjab4.5     SULPHURIC ACID (H2SO4)
Sulphuric acid was first prepared by a muslim scientist Jabir bin Hayyan 
in 8th century. In Europe, in 14th and 15th centuries, its preparation on 
commercial level was started due to the awareness of its properties and uses. It was called “oil of vitriol” .It does not occur as such in nature , however, small quantities of H
2SO4 are found in the waters of some springs and rivers.
4.5.1      Manufacture of Sulphuric Acid
 Sulphuric acid is being manufactured commonly by contact process.
This method was developed by Knietsch in Germany. Basically, it involves the catalytic combination of sulphur and oxygen to form SO
2 which is then 
dissolved in water to form H2SO4.Contact Process
Animation 4.8 :  Sulfuric acid - contact process
Source and Credit: Dynamicscience31
Group VA and VIA Elements eLearn.PunjabSO2 obtained by burning sulphur or iron pyrites is oxidized to SO3 in the 
presence of V2O5 which acts as a catalyst. The  best  yield  of  SO3 can be obtained 
by using excess of oxygen or air and keeping the temperature between 
400-500°C. SO3 formed is absorbed in concentrated H2SO4 and “Oleum” (H2S2O7) 
formed can be converted to sulphuric acid of any strength by mixing adequate quantities of water.The process is completed in the steps given below.Principle
