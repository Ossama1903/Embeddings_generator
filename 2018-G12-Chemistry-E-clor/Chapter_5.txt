5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabHalogens exist as discrete diatomic molecules in all phases (gas, liquid or 
solid ).Fluorine and chlorine are gases of pale yellow and greenish yellow colours respectively at room temperature and pressure. Bromine is a liquid of red-brown colour and iodine is a metallic-appearing shiny greyish black solid. The halogens have irritating odours, and they attack the skin. Bromine in particular causes burns that heal slowly.The outer shell of halogens have the configuration ns
2 np5 (one electron short of the stable octet of the noble 
gases). The electronic configurations and the important physical properties of the halogens are given in the Table 5.1The elements fluorine (F), chlorine(Cl), bromine(Br), iodine(I) and astatine(At) 
are called halogens.These elements are called the halogens from Greek hals, “salt” and gennan, “to form or generate” , because they are literally the salt formers.The halogen elements form a group of very reactive non-metals and are quite similar to each other in their chemical properties. First four elements are the common elements of the halogen family but astatine is a rare halogen. It is radioactive and its most stable isotope has a half life of 8.3 hrs.5.1 Introduction1.

5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabThe intermolecular attraction is greater in the larger molecules having 
greater masses. Due to their large size the van der Waal’s forces in iodine molecules are stronger than in the smaller molecules of the other halogens.The ionization energy data of the halogens show that the 
fluorine atom holds its electrons tightly whereas the electrons are least tightly bound in iodine. The trend can be correlated with the sizes of the halogen atoms as shown in the Table 5.1.The electron affinity values of halogens are large and negative, that is why halogens gain electrons readily. They have large, positive standard electrode potentials and their electronegatvities are also fairly high.

Elements with the higher values of electronegativity usually exist as 
negative ions, and those with the lower values of electronegativity exist as positive ions. Elements with intermediate values of electronegativity are often found as ions or molecules or in free (elemental)form.5.2 OCCURRENCETable 5.1 The Electronic Configurations and the Important Physical

and are found in sea, in salt lakes and as underground beds of salt.

Due to the small size of the F atom (or F- ion), there will be a better overlap 
of orbitals and consequently leads to shorter and stronger bonds with 
elements other than O, N and itself. Ionic fluorides have higher lattice energies than the other halides and these values are responsible for the insolubility of the fluorides of Ca, Mg, Ba,Sr and lanthanides in water. Due to the low dissociation energy of fluorine molecule, it is highly reactive. The other halogens react slowly under similar conditions. The fluorides are, however, more stable with respect to dissociation into elements.
Due to the restriction of valence shell to an octet, many fluoro 
compounds show inertness, e.g. CF
4 and SF6. Also due to this 
restriction, fluorine remains restricted to -1 oxidation state.Fluorine is the only element that combines directly with noble gases like Kr, Xe, and Rn forming their fluorides.
5.4 OXIDIZING PROPERTIES
Relative Reactivities of the Halogens as Oxidizing AgentsAll the free halogens act as oxidizing agents when they react with metals or nonmetals. The reactant elements acquire positive oxidation state in the compounds formed. On forming ionic compounds with metals, the halogens gain electrons and are converted to negative halide ions.The halogens form a homologous series but fluorine differs from the other 
halogens in many respects which is due to:
2 2Na + Cl 2Na Cl+- →7
5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabThe oxidizing power of halogens decreases with increase in atomic 
number. Fluorine has the highest oxidizing power and iodine the least. The order of decreasing power as an oxidizing agent is F
2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2
 The oxidizing power of halogens depends upon the following factors:1.
 Ener
gy of dissociation
2.
 Elec
tron affinity of atoms
3.
 H
ydration energies of ions
4.
 Hea
ts of vapourization (for Br2 and I2)
If a halogen has a low energy of dissociation, a high electron affinity and a higher hydration energy of its ions, it will have a high oxidizing power.
Oxidizing power of F
2 is higher, because it has low energy of 
dissociation and higher hydration energy of its ions. Due to the 
relative strength as oxidizing agents, it is possible for each free halogen to oxidize the ions of other halogens next to it in the family. Standard electrode potential measures oxidizing power.

Fluorine and chlorine can oxidize various coloured 
dyes to colourless substances, e.g. litmus and univer -
sal indicator can be decolourized when exposed to fluorine or chlorine. When used for bleaching, chlorine acts as an oxidizing agent.--

5.5 COMPOUNDS OF HALOGENS
5.5.1 Hydrides (hydrogen halides, HX)
All halogens react with hydrogen forming hydrides. The reaction of molecular hydrogen and fluorine is very fast and explosive. With chlorine, molecular hydrogen reacts in the presence of sunlight. Bromine and iodine react with molecular hydrogen at a higher temperature. The reaction with iodine is very slow and reversible. Direct combination is used as a preparative method only for HCl and HBr. Hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride can also be obtained by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid on fluorides and chlorides, but analogous reactions with bromides and iodides result in partial oxidation of the hydrogen halide to the free halogen.
Properties of Hydrogen Halides
HF is a colourless volatile liquid whereas other hydrogen halides (HCI, HBr, HI) are colourless gases at room temperature. They give fumes in moist air. They are strong irritants.24 24

5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabChain polymers may also exist under certain conditions. Chains and rings of 
HF are of various sizes, some of these persist in the vapour phase as well. Some of the physical properties of hydrogen halides are given in Table 5.2.Hydrogen fluoride attacks glass and has found applications as a non-aqueous solvent. It can be handled in teflon ( polytetrafluoroethylene) containers or if absolutely dry, in copper or stainless- steel vessels kept under vacuum. Pure liquid HF is strongly hydrogen bonded and is a viscous liquid. Its viscosity is less than that of water due to the absence of a three dimensional network of H-bonds which occur in H
2O.
Hydrogen bonding is also responsible for the association of HF molecules in the vapour phase. Various test results indicate that gaseous HF consists of an equilibrium mixture of monomers and cyclic hexamers, Fig.5.2.

5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabSince the dipole moment of molecules decreases from HCI to 
HI, probably dipole-induced dipole forces play an important role in the intermolecular binding of the heavier HX molecules. Melting points, boiling points, heats of fusion and heats of vapourization 
generally increase regularly from HCl to HI. The HF has much higher values for these properties due to hydrogen bonding. A very high boiling point of hydrogen fluoride is a major evidence of the presence of hydrogen bonding among its molecules.The relative volatility of HCl, HBr and HI reflects the strengthening of the van der Waal’s forces due to increasing size of halogens.
Hydrogen iodide is a strong reducing agent. In redox reactions the hydrogen halides are oxidized to elemental halogens, e.g.
In water, hydrogen halides give hydrofluoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids. Hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid due to limited ionization. The other three acids are very strong acids. The acidic strength increases in the order.HF<HCl<HBr<HI
HF<HCl<HBr<HI2 2 2HI+S I +H S���� ��
The halogens do not react directly with oxygen. With the help of some indirect methods, following oxides of group VIIA elements have been made.5.5.2 Oxides of HalogensThe strength of the hydrogen halogen bond is very high in HF. It decreases with increasing size of the halogen atom. The bond strength is reflected in the case of dissociation of hydrogen halides at elevated temperatures.
HF, HCl, HBr and HI act as reducing agents in the following order:11

OXIDES OF CHLORINE
The oxides of chlorine are generally unstable. It is not possible 
to synthesize them by direct combination of the elements Cl
2 and O2. They have extensive industrial use as commercial 
bleaching agents for wood, paper- pulp and for water treatment.12

This reaction is violent. To control the reaction oxalic acid should be 
added.
CIO2 explodes into Cl2 and O2 on warming. It is soluble in water and is stable 
in dark. It decomposes slowly in H2O to HCI and HCIO3. It is a paramagnetic 
substance. It is used as an antiseptic, for purification of water and to bleach cellulose material.-+

5.5.3 Reactions of Chlorine with Cold and Hot NaOH
The  reactions  of  chlorine  with cold and hot NaOH are examples of “Disproportionation reactions” .
A reaction in which a species (molecule, atom or ion)is simultaneously
oxidized and reduced, is called a “disproportionation reaction” .In cold (15°C) state chlorine will react with NaOH (aq) to form hypochlorite and a halide.

The reaction is a disproportionation reaction, because the zero oxidation state of chlorine atom in Cl

No oxygen containing stable acid of fluorine is known (HOF is prepared recently, but it is highly unstable). Other halogens form oxyacids though most of them cannot be isolated in pure form and are stable only in aqueous solutions in the form of their salts.5.5.4 Oxyacids
An important class of the compounds of the halogens is the oxygen containing acids and their salts.
A system of nomenclature for these acids and their salts is based on the 
oxidation state of the halogen atom. According to this system, characteristic prefixes and suffixes are attached to a stem that is derived from the name of the central nonmetal (halogen) atom. The system is as follows:-
1.
 S
ome common acid is orbitrarily called the _____ ic acid (e.g. HCIO3 is 
designated as chloric acid). The name of a salt of this acid ends in _____ ate.
2.
 A
n acid whose parent atom has an oxidation state next lower than the 
_____ ic acid (one less oxygen atom) is called ous acid and the name of the salt of this acid ends in _____ ite. For example, chlorous acid (HCIO
2).
3.
 T
he acid in which the oxidation state of the parent atom is higher than it 
is in the _____ ic acid (one more oxygen atom) is called per_____ ic acid. A salt of this acid is a per _____ ate salt. For example, perchloric acid (HCIO
4).15
5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.Punjab4.  An acid in which the oxidation state of the parent atom is lower than it is 
in the___ ous acid is called hypo _____ ous acid and a salt of this acid is a hypo _____ ite salt. For example, hypochlorous acid (HCIO).5.   The root of the name of the acid or the salt indicates the parent atom.
Table 5.4 shows the oxyacids of halogens (other than fluorine)

It is evident from the above given formulas of the oxy acids that 
the halogen serves as a central atom to which one or more oxygen atoms are covlently bonded. These bonds are polar in character due to the electronegativity difference between halogen and oxygen.
The increase in the oxidation state of the halogen from +1 to + 7 is
 accompanied by :(a)     an increase in the thermal stability of the acid(b)     the decrease in oxidizing power of the acid(c)      the increase in acidic strength of the acid
The more the number of oxygen atoms in the series of oxyacids of a halogen, 
the greater is the thermal stability.
The acid strength increases with the increase in the number of oxygen 
atoms. As the oxidation state of the halogen increases, the bonding electrons are shifted away from the Hatom and the tendency of the molecule to lose a proton increases. This accounts for the change of strength of oxyacids. The oxyacids of halogens show their strength in the order given below:16
5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.Punjab432 HXO >HXO >HXO >HXO
An oxyacid molecule contains hydrogen linked to the halogen through an 
oxygen atom.
The oxyacids of chlorine are stronger than the corresponding oxyacids of 
bromine which are, in turn, stronger than the corresponding oxyacids of iodine. It is due to decrease in the electronegativity and increase in the size of the halogen.
We will discuss perchloric acid (HClO
4) only at this stage.
PERCHLORIC ACID (HCIO4)
Perchloric acid (HClO4)is commonly obtained in aqueous solution. 
Pure anhydrous compound can by prepared by distilling a mixture of 
potassium perchlorate (KCIO4) and conc. H2SO4  under reduced pressure.
Perchloric acid is a colourless hygroscopic liquid. At normal pressure it freezes at -112°C and boils with decomposition at 90° C.
In the cold and dilute state,perchloric acid is a very weak oxidizing  agent  
but when hot and concentrated its oxidizing power is enhanced. Dissolving power of perchloric acid is enhanced due to its oxidizing strength. Perchloric acid is the strongest of all the acids in an aqueous medium.
Due to its oxidizing effect, acidic strength and solubility of its salts, it is 
considered as a valuable analytical reagent.Pure perchloric acid decomposes explosively when heated. That is why it is stored and used as 67% solution in water. Perchloric acid reacts with organic substances violently.Ä

5.5.5 Bleaching Powder, (Ca(OCl)Cl)
Bleaching powder can be manufactured by the action of chlorine 
on dry slaked lime using any one of the following methods:
(a)   Hasenclever’s method (old method)
(b)   Beckmann’s method (modern method)The reaction in both the cases will be:

Slaked lime                          Ble aching powderCa(OH) +Cl Ca(OCl)Cl+H O  →
The apparatus used in this method consists of 4 to 8 iron cylinders placed one above the other horizontally. They are interconnected and provided with stirrers. The slaked lime is added in through a hopper in the upper cylinder and is transported from one cylinder to the other with rotating stirrers. Chlorine introduced into the lowest cylinder rises up and reacts with slaked lime to form bleaching powder, which is collected through the outlet in the lowest cylinder.(1)   Hasenclever’s Method18
5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.Punjab
(2)   Beckmann’s Method
In this method a cast iron tower with eight horizontal shelves is used.
In each shelf there is a rotating rake.Powdered slaked lime is introduced through hopper at the top with compressed air. A mixture of hot air and chlorine are introduced from the base of the tower. The slaked lime is pushed down by the rotating rakes while chlorine rises up. Reaction between slaked lime and chlorine produces bleaching powder which is collected at the bottom of the tower, Fig.5.319
5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabThe apparatus works on the countercurrent principle. Thus 
maximum reaction of slaked lime and chlorine is brought about with very little loss of chorine. Bleaching powder should always be packed in air tight containers to avoid the loss of chlorine.
Bleaching powder is a yellowish white powder with strong smell of chlorine. Some of its chemical properties are given below.1. It is an oxidizing agent. This property is due to the generation of hypochlorite ion (OCl) in water.
2. With dilute acid it gives hypochlorous acid.
3. If excess of an acid (weak or strong) is added to bleaching powder, 
chlorine is given out.

The amount of chlorine thus set free is called “available chlorine” . The activity of bleaching  powder is measured in terms of available chlorine. The average percentage of available chlorine in bleaching powder is 35-40 percent. The bleaching action of bleaching powder is due to its oxidative character.

5.6 COMMERCIAL USES OF HALOGEN AND THEIR 
COMPOUNDS
Fluorine is used for the preparation of freons. Freon is the commercial 
name of low molecular mass fluorochlorocarbons, CCl2F2, CClF3. 
These are being used as refrigerants and aerosol propellants.
Fluorine is used to prepare Teflon (-CF2— CF2-)n. It 
is a polymerized tetrafluoro ethylene compound. It is a valuable plastic which resists the action of oxidants, acids and alkalies.Corrosion-proof parts of machinery are made of it.It is used for coating the electrical wiring.Teflon is also used as a non-stick coating for cooking pans.Halothane is used as an anaesthetic.
Fluorides in toothpastes build a protective coating on teeth.Chlorine is used in the manufacture of bleaching powder.It is used as a disinfectant in swimming pools and water treatment plants. A number of antiseptics, insecticides, weedkillers and herbicides are manufactured from chlorine.It is also used in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid, which is the cheapest industrial acid.Chlorine is also used in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. Chloroform and carbon tetrachloride are prepared from chlorine which are used as solvents.21
5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabEthylene dibromide (C2H4Br2) is added to leaded gasoline to save 
the engine from lead oxide and lead sulphate deposits. Bromine 
is also used as fungicide. Silver bromide is used in photography.The major applications of iodine are in pharmaceutical industry.It is used as disinfectant and germicide.Tincture of iodine and iodex are popular preparations of iodine.
Diet with insufficient iodide ions leads to an enlargement of the thyroid 
(Goiter). To ensure the presence of iodide ion in the diet, sodium or potassium iodide is added to the common salt which is known as iodized salt.

The elements helium(He), neon (Ne), argon(Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon (Rn) are placed in the zero group or group VIIIA of the periodic table. All the elements of this group are colourless and odourless monoatomic gases which can be liquefied and solidified. These are called noble gases or sometime known as rare gases. The noble gases occur as minor constituents of the atmosphere (about 1%). The electronic configurations and some physical properties of noble gases are given in the Table 5.5.

5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabThe noble gases are isolated from air, either by fractional distillation or by some 
chemical method. The principal commercial source of Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe is air.Helium is present on earth as a result of radioactive decay. After hydrogen, it is the second most abundant element in the universe. a-Particles are doubly ionized helium atoms He
2+. It is simple and economical to isolate the helium gas
 from certain natural gases by liquefaction method.
Neon is 1/65000th part of the atmosphere and it is also isolated during 
liquefaction of air. In a discharge tube, neon glows reddish (of all the noble gases, the discharge of neon is the most intense at ordinary voltage and current). Liquid neon has over 40 times more refrigeration capacity than liquid helium.
Traces of krypton are present in air. It is a colourless, odourless and fairly expensive gas. It is characterized by its brilliant green and orange spectral lines. Its compound krypton difluoride (KrF
2) can be prepared by various methods.
Xenon is present in the atmosphere to a very small extent (0.08 ppm). It is obtained as a by-product during the fractional liquefaction of air. Xenon is available
commercially in cylinders at high pressure. It reacts with fluorine but not with water. However it is slightly soluble in water to the extent of about 110 ml/lit at 20°C.
Radon is the  a-decay product of the radium. Radon is present to a very 
small extent in the atmosphere and it could be obtained as a by-product from the liquefaction of air. However, the small quantities of this gas which are usually needed can be collected from the radioactive decay of radium isotopes.

The noble gases have valence shells which are closed octets (except He). Due to closed shells their ionization energy values are very high. They have low boiling points. The boiling point of helium is the lowest of any known substance. Their boiling points increase with increasing atomic number down the group.Argon is a colourless and odourless gas. It is very inert and not known to formany true chemical compound. It is obtained as a by-product during the liquefaction of air.23
5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabThe very low values of melting and boiling points and low heats of 
vapourization show that noble gases have weak forces of attraction between their atoms. As there are no ordinary electron pair interaction, these weak forces must be of the van derWaals type.
The solubility of the noble gases in water increases with increasing atomic 
number. This is because the bigger atoms are more readily polarized by water molecules.
5.7.2 Compounds of Xenon
Xenon reacts directly with fluorine only. The known oxidation state of  Xenon in its compounds range from +2 to +8. These compounds are stable and can be obtained in large quantities. Some important compounds of Xenon are give in the Table 5.6

5. The Halogens and the Noble Gases eLearn.PunjabXeF6 requires more severe conditions. Xe and F2 are taken in 3:20 ratio in 
a stainless steel vessel and heated to 300°C at 50 atmospheric pressure. 
More than 95% conversion to XeF6 takes place. XeF6 is a crystalline solid. 
It is colourless in the solid state but yellow in liquid and gaseous forms.5.7.3 Fluorides of Xenon
XeF2 can be prepared by direct interaction of the elements.The 
compound formed should be removed immediately from the reaction zone, otherwise further reaction with F
2 will give XeF4. 
The reaction is completed in about 8 hours. XeF2 is a crystalline 
solid. It is stored in nickel vessels. XeF2 is a mild fluorinating agent.
XeF4 can be prepared by heating a mixture of Xe and F2 in 1:5 
ratio in a nickel container under 6 atmospheric pressure for a few hours. It can be stored in nickel vessels. Its properties are similar to that of XeF
2 but it is a strong fluorinating agent.Three known fluorides of Xenon are XeF2, XeF4 and XeF6.

Fluorides of xenon can be reduced with hydrogen at 400°C, giving xenon and
 hydrofluoric acid.
Xenon tetra-fluoride is a good fluorinating agent and can be used to prepare metal fluorides as follows:
Reaction occurs with explosion when XeF
4 is brought in contact with liquid
 ammonia.

reacts with oxygen difluoride in an electric discharge.5.7.4 Xenon Oxyfluorides
Xenon oxytetrafluoride, XeOF4 is also formed by a rapid reaction of XeF6 
with silica (quartz).
