Source and Credit : rationalwikiAlcohols, phenols and ethers are classes of organic 
compounds which are much closer to water in structure and hence considered as derivatives of water.
Alcohols and phenols are much more close to one another in structure and proper ties. Both contain hydroxyl (-OH) group so they may also be termed as hydroxy derivatives of alkanes and benzene respectively. In ether both hydrogens of water are replaced by alkyl or phenyl groups.11.2 ALCOHOLS
They are represented by a general formula ROH where R is an alkyl group which maybe         CH
3— ,CH3CH2 — , (CH3)2C H — and C6H5 — CH2— ,etc.
Classification
Alcohols are classified into monohydric and polyhydric alcohols. Monohydric alcohols contain one -OH group while polyhydric alcohols may contain two, three or more OH groups and named as dihydric or trihydric alcohols, etc.
Monohydric alcohols are further classified into primary, secondary and 
tertiary alcohols. In primary alcohols, -OH functional group is attached with primary carbon atom, in secondary alcohols with secondary carbon atom and in tertiary alcohols it is attached with a tertiary carbon atom.
11.2.1 NOMENCLATURE OF ALCOHOLS
There are two systems of naming alcohols
Common or Trivial Names
(a) Lower and simpler alcohols are usually known by their common 
or trivial names, obtained by adding the name of alcohol after the name of the alkyl group to which the OH group is attached, e.g.,
Methyl alcohol3 25 65 2 CH OH                C H OH                 C H  CH  OH
Benzyl alcohol Ethyl alcohol4 5
11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS 11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab(b) I.U.RA.C Names
In this system the alcohols are named according to the following rules.
(i) The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the hydroxyl group is taken as parent hydrocarbon. The ending ‘e’ of alkane is replaced by ol, e.g;
3 3 7 5 11 CH OH              C H OH             C H OH
Methanol Pentanol Propanel
(ii) The position of OH group is indicated by a number placed before the name. The carbon chain is numbered, starting from the end where carbon atom attached with OH group gets the lowest possible number, e.g;
(iii) If more than one OH groups are attached, they are indicated by an appropriate suffix diol, triol, etc., e.g;
(iv) The unsaturated alcohols are numbered in such a way that hydroxyl group rather than the point ot unsaturation gets the lower number, e.g.
(v) When hydroxyl group is not a preferred functional group as in hydroxy acids, aldehydes and ketones, the substituent name hydroxy is used as a prefix to indicate the position of OH group, e.g.;The names of some alcohols in the two systems are given below

Methanol

23 450°C:200atmCO+2H CH OH  →Formerly methanol was prepared by distillation of wood. That is why 
it is also called as wood spirit. Now-a-days methanol is prepared from carbon monoxide and hydrogen or water gas as follows:
Fig. 11.1 Flow sheet diagram for the manufacturing of methanol
First of all a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen is purified. It is compressed under a pressure of 200 atmospheres and taken into a reaction chamber by means of coiled pipes Here the catalyst is heated upto 450-500 
OC. Gases react to form methanol vapours. These vapours are passed 
through a condenser to get methanol. Unreacted gases are recycled through compressor to reaction chamber.

Ethanol is prepared on industrial scale world over, by the process of fermentation. Fermentation is a biochemical process which occurs in the presence of certain enzymes secreted by microorganisms such as yeast. Optimum temperature for this process of fermentation is 25-35°C. Moreover, proper aeration, dilution of solution and the absence of any preservative are essential conditions for fermentation. In Pakistan ethanol is prepared by the fermentation of molasses starch grains or fruit juices.
From Molasses
The residue obtained after the crystallization of sugar from concentrated 
sugar cane juice is called molasses. It undergoes fermentation in the presence of enzymes present in yeast to give ethanol.
From Starch
Alcohol obtained by fermentation is only upto 12% and never exceeds 14% because beyond this limit enzymes become inactive. This alcohol is distilled again and again to obtain 95% alcohol which is called rectified spirit. Absolute alcohol can aioo be obtained by redistillation of rectified spirit in the presence of CaO which absorbs its moisture.8 9
11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS 11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabDenaturing of Alcohol
Sometimes ethanol is denatured by addition of 10% methanol to avoid 
its use for drinking purposes. Such alcohol is called methylated spirit. A small quantity of pyridine or acetone may also be added for this purpose.
Other Methods of Preparation of Alcohols
Alcohols can be obtained by the hydration of aikenes and by the reaction of Grignard reagents with aldehydes or ketones. Both these methods have already been discussed in the previous chapter.
11.2.3 Physical Properties
Lower alcohols are generally colourless toxic liquids with characteristic sweet smell and burning taste They are readily soluble in water but solubility decreases in higher alcohols. The solubility of alcohols is due to hydrogen bonding which is prominent in lower alcohols but diminishes in higher alcohols.
Melting and boiling points of alcohols are higher than corresponding alkanes. Methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol are liquids while methane and ethane are gases. This is also due to hydrogen bonding which is present in alcohols but absent in alkanes.
11.2.4 Reactions of Alcohols
Alcohols react with other reagents in two ways
(i) Reactions in which C — O bond breaks(ii) Reactions in which O — H bond breaks
If a nucleophile attacks, it is the C — O bond which breaks. On the other hand, if an electrophile attacks on alcohol, it is the O — H bond which breaks.Which bond will break depends upon the nature of the attacking reagent.

11.4 USES OF ALCOHOLS
Methanol is used as a solvent for fats oils, paints, varnishes. It is also used as antifreeze in the radiators of automobiles and for denaturing of alcohol.Ethanol is used as a solvent, as a drink and as a fuel in some countries. Moreover it. is used in pharmaceutical preparations and as a preservative for biological specimen.
11.5 PHENOL
Aromatic compounds which contain one or more OH groups directly attached with carbon of benzene ring are called Phenols. The simplest example is phenol which is also known as Carbolic acid i.e. C
6H5OH. It was first obtained from coaltar by Runge in 1834.

11.5.2 Physical Properties
Phenol is a colourless, crystalline, deliquescent solid with characteristic phenolic odour having melting point 41°C and boiling point 182°C. It is sparingly soluble in water forming pink solution at room temperature but completely soluble above 68.5°C. It is poisonous and used as a disinfectant in hospitals and washrooms.11.5.3 Reactions of Phenol
Phenol shows two type of reactions.1.
 Reactions due to — OH group
2.
 Reactions due to benzene ring
Phenols are less reactive to nucleophiles so nucleophilic attack is less favoured, i.e - OH is not easy to replace while electrophilic attack on the ring is easy.
11.5.4 Acidic Behaviour of Phenol
Phenol is much more acidic than alcohols but less acidic than carboxylic 
acids. It dissolves readily in alkalies but it is too weak to affect the litmus paper or to evolve CO
2 from carbonates. Its dissociation constant 
(Ka) is 1.3xl0-10.
Phenol is partially soluble in water and its solution has a pH of around 5 or 6. This makes phenol different from aliphatic alcohols.16 17
11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS 11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabThe reason why phenol is acidic lies in the nature of the phenoxide 
ion. The negative charge on oxygen atom can become involved with the p-electron cloud on the benzene ring. The negative charge is thus 
delocalized in the ring and the phenoxide ion becomes relatively stable. This type of delocalization is not possible with alcohols.
Relative acidic strength of alcohol, phenol, water and carboxylic acid is as follows,
11.5.5 Reactions of Phenol Due to - OH Group.Reduction with Zn
Salt Formation
Phenol reacts with alkalies to form salts, e.g;
Ester Formation
Phenol reacts with acetyl chloride in the presence of a base to form ester.
11.5.6 Reactions of Phenol Due to Benzene Ring
Nitration
Phenol reacts with dil. and conc. HNO3 at different temperatures 
as follows.18 19
11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS 11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabSulphonation
Phenol reacts with conc. H2SO4 at room temperature 
giving ortho and para hydroxy benzene sulphonic acids.
Halogenation
An aqueous solution of phenol reacts with bromine 
water to give white ppt. of 2,4,6- tribromophenol.
Hydrogenation
When hydrogen is passed through phenol at 150°C 
in the presence of Ni catalyst it gives cyclohexanol.
Reaction with formaldehyde
Phenol reacts with formaldehyde (methanal) in the presence of acid or alkali to give hydroxy benzyl alcohol which on further reaction with other phenol molecules yield a polymer called bakelite.
11.6 ETHERS
Ethers are classified into two categories1.
 Simple 
or symmetrical ethers, which contain two same alkyl groups e.g. di-
methyl ether CH3OCH3 and diethyl ether CH3— CH2— O — CH2 — CH3.
2.
 Mixed 
or unsymmetrical ethers, which contain different alkyl or phenyl 
groups, e.g., ethyl methyl ether CH3— O — CH2 — CH3.20 21
11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS 11. ALCOHOLS, PHENOLS AND ETHERS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab11.6.1 Nomenclature
Ethers are named either by I.U.P.A.C. system or by common names. In 
I.U.P.A.C. system the large alkyl (R ) group is taken as parent molecule and given the last name (suffix) while the smaller alkyl group along with ox-ygen is used as prefix and given the name alkoxy (e.g.methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, etc).
I. U.P. A. C. names are not common as they are difficult. Usual-ly ethers are known by their common names, as given below;
Formula Common Names I.U.P.A.C
CH3OCH3Dimethyl ether Methoxy methane
CH3OC2H5Methyl ethylether Methoxy ethane
C2H5OC2H5Diethyl ether Ethoxy ethane
C2H5O  CH2 — CH2 — CH3Ethyl n-propylether Ethoxy propane
CH3OC6H5Methyl phenyl ether Methoxy benzene
11.6.2 Preparation of Ethers
Ethers are prepared from alcohols either directly or indirectly. Usually they are obtained by the following methods.
(i) By Williamsons synthesis
Alcohols are reacted with metallic sodium to form alkoxides. This alkoxide 
ion is a strong nucleophile and readily reacts with alkyl halide to produce an ether.

11.6.3 Physical Properties
Usually ethers are volatile liquids, highly inflammable with low boiling points. They are slightly soluble in water but freely soluble in organic solvents. Ether molecules do not show hydrogen bonding with one another but they show weak hydrogen bonding with water molecules due to which they are slightly soluble in water.
11.6.4 Chemical Reactivity
Ethers are comparatively inert substances. The reagents like ammonia, alkalies, dilute acids and metallic sodium, have no action on ethers in cold state. Moreover, they are not oxidized or reduced easily. However ethers show some reactions, e.g.
1.
 With 
hydrogen iodide ethers give alcohols 
which can react further to give alkyl iodides.
2.  Ethers also react with hot phosphorus pentachloride to give alkyl chloride.
