9.1    INTRODUCTION
The term aromatic was derived from the Greek word ‘aroma’ meaning 
“fragrant” and was used in Organic Chemistry for a special class of compounds. These compounds have a low hydrogen to carbon ratio in their molecular formula and have a characteristic odour. However, it was soon realized that many aromatic compounds are odourless whereas many others are fragrant though they are not aromatic.
 Further, when aromatic compounds of higher molecular mass were subjected 
to various methods of degradation, they often produced benzene or derivatives of benzene. It was observed that almost all the aromatic compounds have a six carbon unit in their molecules like benzene. Hence, benzene was recognized as the simplest and the parent member of this class of compounds.
So aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene and all those compounds that are structurally related to benzene.It appears from the definition of aromatic hydrocarbons that any study of this class of compounds must begin with the study of benzene.
Benzene has characteristic structural features. It has a regular planar hexagonal structure. On the basis of the number of benzene rings aromatic hydrocarbons can be categorized into following classes.
a. Monocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and their derivativesb. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
a. Monocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and their Derivatives
Aromatic hydrocarbons containing one benzene ring in their molecules are called Monocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene and its derivatives.

zene rings in their molecules are called Polycyclic Aromat-ic Hydrocarbons. They may be divided into two main classes.
(i)  Those in which benzene rings are isolated, e.g. bi      phenyl,diphenylmethane, etc.

9.2 NOMENCLATURE 
(Monocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and their Derivatives)
The nomenclature of the aromatic hydrocarbons is much more complex than that of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The system used for naming benzene and its derivatives generally depends on the number of substituents on the benzene ring. b. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
1. Mono-substituted benzene derivatives are named by prefixing benzene with 
the name of the substituent. The whole name is written as one word, e.g.
2.  There are certain monosubstituted benzene derivatives which are given the special  names, like methylbenzene as toluene, hydroxybenzene as phenol etc.Some important rules of naming are given below.6 7
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabWhen a hydrogen atom is removed from benzene, we get a phenyl group sym-
bolized by C6H5- or Ph-. Substituted phenyl groups are called aryl groups.
3. The second substituent in benzene would give rise to three iso-meric products designated as ortho (1,2), meta(1,3) and para(1,4),e.g.All the six positions in benzene are exactly equivalent so there is only one monosubsituted benzene.

er groups are numbered by counting from position 1 in the manner which gives them the lowest number.The order of priority of the groups (left to right):
— COOH, — CN, — CHO, — COCH
3, — OH, — NH, — OR, — R.
5. If the two substituents are different and they are not present in priority order list, they are named in alphabeti-cal order. The last named substituent will be at position 1, e.g.,
6. If there is a substituent on the ring which gives a special name to the molecule, then special name is used as parent name to the molecule, e.g.8 9

Benzene was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1825 in the gas pro-
duced by the destructive distillation of vegetable oil and twen-ty years later it was also found in coal-tar by Hoffmann.
9.3.1 Structure of Benzene
Molecular Formula1.
 The empirical formula of benzene 
is determined by the elemental analysis.
2.
 Its molecular mass determined by 
the vapour density method is 78.108. 
This is six times the empirical formula mass (CH = 12 + 1 = 13). Therefore, the molecular formula of benzene is C
6H6.
3.
 The molecular formula of benzene 
indicates that it is highly unsaturated 
compound.
9.3.2 Straight Chain Structures Ruled Out:
i) Two of the possible straight chain formulas suggested for benzene are : 
HC C≡2CH2CH
2C CH
H C=CH≡
CC≡2 CH=CH(1,5-Hexadiyne). 
 (l,5-Hexadiene-3-yne).
A compound having a structure as above should behave like an alkene or alkyne, both are oxidized by alkaline KMnO
4 solution. On the 
contrary, benzene is stable to KMnO4 solution i.e. it does not decolorize 
KMnO4 solution. Benzene gives addition reactions with hydrogen 
and halogens, which indicate the presence of three double bonds.But benzene also gives substitution reactions with conc. HNO3 and 
conc. H2SO4 which indicate that benzene has a saturated structure.
ii) Considering a straight chain structure for benzene and further assuming that each carbon carries one H-atom, it should be capable of forming three monosubstitution products.
But benzene yields only one monosubstituent product.X XX

iii) The molecular formula of benzene C6H6 does not correspond 
to any of the open chain hydrocarbons, such as alkane C
nH2n+2(C6H14), alkene CnH2n(C6H12) or alkyne CnH2n-2 (C6H10).
It means benzene does not belong to open chain hydrocarbon and therefore possibility of a straight chain structure is ruled out.
9.3.3 Kekule’s Structure
The structure of benzene continued to be a serious problem for chemists for about 40 years. A German chemist, Kekule at last solved the problem in 1865. Kekule proposed a cyclic regular hexagonal structure for benzene, which contains three double bonds alternating with three single bonds.
He supported his theory by the following arguments.
(i)   Benzene gives only one monosubstituted product.10 11
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabThese points confirm the regular hexagonal structure for benzene in which 
all the carbon atoms are occupying identical positions in the molecule. Therefore, benzene forms only one toluene, one phenol and one nitrobenzene.(ii)  Benzene gives only three disubstituted products.

iv) Benzene adds three molecules of chlorine in the presence of sunlight.
These two reactions confirm the presence of three double bonds alternating with three single bonds.
9.3.4 X-Ray Studies of Benzene Structure
The X-ray studies of benzene have confirmed the hexagonal structure for it. These studies have also revealed that all the carbon and hydrogen atoms are in the same plane. All the angles are of 120°. All C - C and C -H bond lengths are 1.397A and 1.09 A, respectively.
Objections to Kekule’s Formula
Kekule’s formula with three double bonds demands a high degree of unsaturation from benzene while usually it exhibits a saturated character. Thus benzene yields substitution products readily and forms addition products reluctantly. Benzene is also a very stable compound. All these properties of benzene can be easily explained using the modem theories about its structure.o o12 13
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab9.3.5 Modern Concepts About the Structure of Benzene Atomic Orbital 
Treatment of Benzene
The hexagonal frame-work of benzene can be conveniently explained using hybridization approach. According to this, each carbon in benzene is sp
2 hybridized. The three sp2 
hybrid orbitals on each carbon are utilized to form three s-bonds, two. with adjacent carbon atoms and one with hydrogen.
The unhybridized 2p
z orbitals remain at right 
angle to these sp2 orbitals. Since all the sp2 
orbitals are in the same plane therefore all 
the carbon and hydrogen atoms are coplanar.
All the angles are of 120° which confirms the 
regular hexagonal structure of benzene . The 
unhybridized 2pz orbitals partially overlap to 
form a continuous sheath of electron cloud, enveloping, above and below, the six carbon-carbon sigma bonds of the ring. Since each 2p
z 
orbital is overlapped by the 2pz orbitals of adjacent 
carbon atoms, therefore, this overlapping gives, 'diffused' or 'delocalized' electron cloud.
9.3.6  The Stability of Benzene
As mentioned earlier benzene is an extraordinary stable molecule. This stability is due to the extensive delocalization of electron cloud. The extent of stability of benzene can be measured by comparing it with hypothetical compound, 1,3,5- cyclohexatriene. This can be done by estimating their heats of hydrogenation. Cyclohexene, a six membered ring containing one double bond, can be easily hydrogenated to give cyclohexane. When the 
�H for this reaction is measured 
it is found to be -119.5 kJ/mole, very much like that of any similarly substituted alkene.
Animation  9.5 : Kekulé benzene
Source & Credit : Ch.imperialWe would expect that hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene would liberate roughly twice as much heat and thus have 
�H equal to about -239 kJ/mole. 
When this experiment is done, the result is �H = -231.5 kJ/mole. This result is 
quite close to what we calculated, and the difference can be explained by taking into account the fact that compounds containing conjugated double bonds are usually somewhat more stable than those containing isolated double bonds.
Calculated �H =   2(-119.5)                = -239 k J/mole
Observed �H                                       = -231.5 k J/mole
If we extend this kind of thinking, and if benzene is simply 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene, we1,3-Cyclohexadiene14 15
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjabwould predict that benzene would liberate approximately -358.5 kJ/mole 
(3 x -119.5) when it is hydrogenated. When the experiment is actually done the result is surprisingly different. The reaction is exothermic but only by -208 k J/mole.
Calculated �H = (3 x -119.5)                =-358.5 kJ/mole
Observed �H                                         = -208 kJ/mole
Difference                                              = 150.5 kJ/mole
When the results are represented by the following figure, it becomes clear that benzene is much more stable than we calculated it to be.
Fig.9.1 Relative stabilities of Cyclohexene,1,3- Cyclohexadiene, 1,3,5-Cyclohexatriene 
(hypothetical) and benzene.Indeed, benzene is more stable than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene by 150.5 kJ/mole. This difference between amount of heat actually released and that calculated on the basis of the Kekule’s structure is now called the ‘Resonance energy’ of the compound. It means benzene shows the phenomenon of resonance which makes it more stable than others. In benzene electrons are delocalized making it a very stable molecule.

zene from a molecular orbital point

“The possibility of different pairing schemes of valence electrons of atoms is called resonance” and the different structures thus arranged are called “Resonance structures”.The resonance is represented by a double headed arrow (
↔) e.g. the following different pairing schemes of the fourth 
valence (the p-electrons) of carbon atoms are possible in benzene.16 17
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab
(a), (b) were proposed by Kekule and c, d, e, were proposed by Dewar. 
The stability of a molecule increases with increase in the number of its resonance structures. Thus molecule of benzene is chemically quite stable.
In Dewar structure the carbon atoms at opposite positions 1-4, 
2-5 and 3-6 are at larger distances than those in the adjacent positions 1-2,2-3,3-4,4-5,5-6 and 6 -1. Therefore the bondings between C
1-C4, C2-C5 and C3-C6 are not favourable energetically.
Hence the Dewar structures for benzene have minor contribution towards the actual structure of benzene.
Infact, the structure of benzene is a resonance hybrid of all the five 
structures (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) in which the Kekule’s structure (a) and (b) have the larger contribution. Therefore, benzene molecule can be represented by either of the two Kekule’s structure.
The three alternate single and double bonds in the Kekule’s structures are called conjugate bonds or resonating bonds.
Since the structure of benzene is a resonance hybrid, therefore all the C-C 
bond lengths are equal but different from those in alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.In alkanes the C-C bond length is 1.54A.In alkenes the C = C bond length is 1.34A.In alkynes the C 
≡ C bond length is 1.20A.
In benzene the C-C bond length is 1.397A.
The C - C bond length in benzene is intermediate 
between those in alkanes and alkenes. The resonating single and double bonds in benzene can better be represented as a complete circle inside the ring.
9.4 PREPARATION OF BENZENE
Benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons are readily obtained in large quantities from coal and petroleum. Benzene and some other hydrocarbons can also be obtained from petroleum by special cracking methods. Some of the methods generally used for the preparation of benzene are as follows.
1. Dehydrogenation of Cyclohexane
When cyclohexane or its derivative is dehydrogenated 
we get benzene or a substituted benzene. The reaction is carried out by the use of a catalyst at elevated temperature.
2. From Acetylene:
Benzene is formed by passing acetylene under pressure over an organo-nickel catalyst at 70°C.eo

9.5 REACTIONS OF BENZENE
9.5.1 General Pattern of Reactivity of Benzene Towards Electrophiles
The highly stable, delocalized electrons of benzene ring are not readily 
available for the nucleophillic attack like the electrons of alkenes. 
Therefore, the electrons of benzene ring do not assist in the attack of weak 
electrophiles. It means that more powerful electrophiles are required to penetrate and break the continuous sheath of electron cloud in benzene, e.g., substitution of halogen in benzene requires iron or corresponding ferric halide as a catalyst. Infact iron too is first converted into FeX
3 which 
further reacts with halogen molecule to produce a powerful electrophile.

9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabThe addition product is not favourable because in its formation the 
characteristic stability of benzene is lost. The only possible product is the substitution product in which the stability of benzene is retained. Therefore, the general pattern of the chemical reactivity of benzene towards electrophiles can be shown as follows.
9.5.2 Electrophilic Substitution Reactions
1. Halogenation
The introduction of halogen group in benzene ring is called “Halogenation” Benzene reacts with halogen in the presence of a catalyst like FeBr
3, 
AlCl3, etc. Chlorination and bromination are normal reactions but 
fluorination is too vigorous to control. Iodination gives poor yield.Mechanism:
The actual halogenating agent is X+ ( i.e. CI+ or Br+) is formed by the following 
mechanism.
When alkyl benzenes are treated with chlorine or bromine in 
the presence of sunlight, only the alkyl groups are substituted.

The introduction of NO2 group in benzene ring is called “Nitration”. 
The nitration of benzene takes place when it is heated with a 
1:1 mixture of con. HNO3 and con.H2SO4 at 50- 55°C. Sulphuric 
acid reacts with nitric acid to generate nitronium ion, (N02+).

9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab9.5.3 Reactions in which Benzene Ring is Involved
1. Addition Reactions
(a) Reduction:
Benzene is reduced to cyclohexane on heating at high 
temperature with hydrogen in the presence of Pt in an acidic solvent (acetic acid) or Ni at 200°C as a catalyst.
(b) Halogenation
Benzene reacts with chlorine and bromine in the presence 
of sunlight to give addition products, hexachlorobenzene or hexabromobenzene. Fluorination is too vigorous while iodination is slow.
(c) Combustion
When benzene is burnt in free supply of air, it is completely oxidized to CO2 
and H2O.
66 2 2 2 2C H 15O 12CO 6H O+→ +(d) Oxidation
i) Catalytic Oxidation
Benzene is not oxidized by KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 at room 
temperature. The ring is destroyed when benzene is 
strongly heated with air in the presence of V2O5 as a catalyst.
ii) Ozonolysis
Benzene reacts with ozone and gives glyoxal through benzene triozonide.
Side Chain Oxidation 
Alkyl benzenes are readily oxidized by acidified KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7. In these 
reactions, the alkyl groups are oxidized keeping the benzene ring intact.30 31
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab
Whatever the length of an alkyl group may be it gives only one 
carboxyl group. Moreover the colour of KMnO4 is discharged. 
Therefore this reaction is used as a test for alkyibenzenes.
9.5.4 Orientation in Electrophilic Substitution reactions
When an electrophilic substitution reaction takes place on benzene ring, we get only one monosubstituted benzene because all the six positions in the ring are equivalent. However, the introduction of a second group into the ring may give three isomeric disubstituted products, ortho, meta and para.
On chance basis 40% ortho, 40% meta and 20% para disubstituted products are expected. 
But the actual disubstitution of benzene does not follow 
this principle of chance, e.g. m - Chloronitro benzene is the main product of the following halogenation reaction.
On the other hand a mixture of o- Chloronitrobenzene and p-Chloronrtrobenzene is obtained from the nitration of chlorobenzene.
It means that the group present in the mono-substituted benzene ring has the directive effect and thus determines the position or orientation for the new incoming groups. Therefore, there are two types of groups:
1. ortho- and para- directing groups
2. meta- directing groups
1. ortho and para Directing Groups
These groups release electrons to the benzene ring, thereby facilitating 
the availability of electrons to the electrophiles at ortho and para positions.32 33
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabThis results in the increased chemical reactivity of benzene ring 
towards electrophilies. The benzene ring can offer more than one positions (ortho and para) to the new incoming groups. These groups are called ortho and para directing groups, e.g.
The electron releasing effect of methyl group is significant and it makes the ring a good nucleophile. Due to this increased reacivity, more nitro groups can enter the ring.
2
Other examples of ortho and para directing groups are:-
32 2 N(CH ) , NH , OH,− −−3 OCH , Cl,− Br, I2. meta -Directin g Groups
These groups withdraw the electrons of the benzene ring towards 
themselves, thereby reducing their availability to the electrophiles. 
This results in the decreased chemical reactivity of benzene. Moreover, 
due to the electron withdrawing effect of such substituents, the ortho and para positions are rendered more electron deficient than the meta position. Thus the incoming electrophile will prefer to attack on meta position rather than ortho and para positions. These groups are called meta-directing groups, e.g.
The substitution of third nitro group is not possible, other examples of meta directing groups  are:
3 NR,+C N,≡ COOH,   CHO,   COR
9.6 COMPARISON OF REACTIVITIES OF ALKANES,ALKENES 
AND BENZENE
We have studied that alkanes are unreactive class of compounds 
and their unreactivity is due to their non-polar nature and the inertness of s-bond. However, they  undergo substitution reactions relatively easily and these reactions involve free radicals.
Alkenes, on the other hand, are very reactive class of compounds 
and their reactivity is due to the inherent weakness of the 
π-bond 
and the availability of π electrons for the electrophilic reagents.34 35
9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons 9. Aromatic Hydrocarbons eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabBenzene is unique in its behaviour. It is highly unsaturated compound 
and at the same time it is very stable molecule. The stability of benzene, as described earlier, is due to the extensive delocalization of 
π-electrons. 
It resembles alkenes when it gives addition reactions. The substitution of benzene, however, does not involve free radicals. These are electrophilic substitution reactions and involve electrophiles. 
Its addition reactions require more drastic conditions than those for alkenes. 
Benzene does not undergo polymerization and it is also resistant to oxidation.
 KEYPOINTS                    
1.
 Aromatic hydrocarbons include 
benzene and all those compounds that are 
structurally related to benzene.
