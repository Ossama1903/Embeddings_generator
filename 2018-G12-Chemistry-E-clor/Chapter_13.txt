Carboxylic acids are further classified as mono, di, tri or poly carboxylic acids as they contain one, two, three or many carboxyl groups respectively in their molecules.Aliphatic monocarboxylic acids
Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids
                                                              
Organic compounds containing                         as a functional group are called
carboxylic acids. The               group which itself is made up of a carbonyl 
group (> C = 0) and a hydroxyl group (-0H) is called a carboxyl group (Carb from carbonyl and oxyl from hydroxyl). Carboxylic acid may be an aliphatic
or an aromatic depending upon whether          is attached to an alkyl 
group (or a hydrogen atom) or an aryl group. Their general formulas are:(- C - OH) 
(- C - OH) 
(- C - OH) 
In this chapter we will discuss, in some detail, the chemistry of 
monocarboxylic acids only.Aromatic monocarboxylic acid                                    Aromatic dicarboxylic acid:4 5
13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab13.2 NOMENCLATURE OF CARBOXYLIC ACIDS
The aliphatic monocarboxylic acids are commonly called fatty acids because 
higher members of this series such as palmitic acid (C15H31COOH), stearic 
acid (C17H35COOH), etc. are obtained by the hydrolysis of fats and oils.
The aliphatic monocarboxylic acids may be given common names or IUPAC names.
13.2.1 Common or Trivial names
The common names of carboxylic acids were derived from the source from which they are isolated. The irritation caused by an ant bite is due to formic acid (Latin word formica, ant). It was first isolated by the distillation of red ants. Similarly acetic acid was first isolated from vinegar and butyric acid was named after butyrum means butter.
13.2.2 The IUPAC Nomenclature
The IUPAC names of saturated monocarboxylic acids are alkanoic acids. These are derived from the names of the alkanes containing the same number of carbon atoms as the acid. The ending “e” of the alkane name is dropped and suffix-oic acid is added. Thus acetic acid gets the name ethanoicaeid.
The position of substituents are indicated by Arabic numerals with the carboxyl group given number 1 as shown below:
The common and IUPAC names of the some common monocarboxylic acids are given in the table below.Table(13.1) Common and IUPAC names of some common carboxylic acids.

13.3 GENERAL METHODS OF PREPARATION
A number of methods for the preparation of carboxylic acids have already been discussed in the previous chapters. However, they are recalled again with different examples.
1. From Primary Alcohols and Aldehydes
Primary alcohols and aldehydes are readily oxidised to corresponding 
carboxylic acids by oxidising agents such as potassium dichromate in an acidic medium.

Aldehydes are easily oxidised to corresponding carboxylic 
acids even by mild oxidizing agents such as Tollen’s Reagent (Ammoniacal silver nitrate).
2. From Alkanenitriles
Compounds having a cyanide ( - C 
≡ N) group are called nitriles. 
Hydrolysis of an alkanenitrile on boiling with mineral acids or alkalis yields 
corresponding carboxylic acid.
Animaton 13.7 : Grignard Reagent Attacking a Ketone
ource & Credit : BenettonplayIt may be noted that acid produced has one carbon atom more than the original alkyl halide.Alkanenitriles can be prepared by treating alkyl halide with alcoholic 
potassium cyanide.
3. From Grignard Reagent
Carboxylic acids can be prepared by the action of Grignard reagent with 
carbon dioxide. This reaction is either carried out by passing carbon dioxide through the ethereal solution of corresponding Grignard reagent or by adding Grignard reagent to crushed dry ice suspended in ether. The addition product on reaction with a mineral acid produces carboxylic acid.8 9
13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab4. By the Hydrolysis of Esters
The appropriate ester on boiling with concentrated sodium 
hydroxide yields sodium salt of the acid.This resulting salt when treated with dilute HC1 gives the free carboxylic acid.
5. By the Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes
Alkenes when heated with alkaline KMnO4 are cleaved at the double bond to 
form carboxylic acids.
13.4 PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
(i) Smell
The first three aliphatic acids i.e. formic acid, acetic acid and propionic 
acid are colourless liquids and have pungent smell. The next three acids C
4 to C6 are colourless liquids with somewhat unpleasant smell.
(ii) Solubility
Among the aliphatic acids, the first four members are very soluble in water due to hydrogen bonding.
(iii) Boiling Point
The boiling points of carboxylic acids are relatively high due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
The molecular mass determination 
in non-polar solvent like benzene shows that Carboxylic acids exist as cyclic dimers.

Melting Points
The melting points of carboxylic acids increase irregularly with the increase in molecular mass. It has been observed that the melting points of carboxylic acids containing even number of carbon atoms are higher than the next lower and higher members containing odd number of carbon atoms e.g.,10 11

13.5 REACTIVITY OF CARBOXYL GROUP (  C  OH)
The carboxyl group displays the chemistry of both the carbonyl 
and the hydroxyl groups. In most reactions of carboxylic acids the carboxyl group is retained however, the reactivity of these molecules is a consequence of the presence of the carbonyl group.
13.6 Reactions of Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids undergo the following type of reactions.a)   The reactions in which hydrogen atom of the carboxyl group is involved (salt 
formation).
b)   The reactions in which OH group is replaced by another group.c)    The reactions involving carboxyl group as a whole.
(a) Reactions Involving H Atom of the Carboxyl Group
Carboxylic acids are weaker acids than mineral acids. They furnish H
+ when 
dissolved in water.
In the presence of water (H2O), the proton breaks away as H3O+ ion.

(b) Reactions Involving the  OH Group of Carboxylic Acids
                                                        The carboxylic acid contains 
 C  OH functional group, and like the 
carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones, is susceptible to attack by a nucleophile. The addition of a nucleophile to the carboxyl group is always followed by the displacement of the 
OH group by some other 
group, producing a carboxylic acid derivative. The OH group can thus be 
replaced by X, OR and NH2 to form halides, esters and amides,respectively.

It is the most important carboxylic acid. Its dilute solution is known as vinegar.
Acetic acid can be prepared by any of the general methods described earlier.16 17
13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.Punjab13.7.1 Laboratory Methods

2. By the Hydrolysis of Methyl Cyanide
Ethanenitrile on hydrolysis with dilute HCI, gives acetic acid through acetamide.
13.7.2 Manufacture of Acetic Acid
1 . From Acetylene
Acetylene is treated with 20% H2SO4 and 1.0% HgSO4 at 80°C to give ethanal 
(acetaldehyde) which is then oxidised using V2O5 to give acetic acid.
2. Acetic acid is also prepared commercially by the oxidation of ethyl 
alcohol.Ethyl alcohol can be commercially prepared from molasses by 
a process called fermentation.It is oxidized by potassium dichromate in the presence of conc. sulphuric acid to give acetaldehyde which is further oxidized under the same conditions to give acetic acid.
13.7.3 Physical Characteristics
Acetic acid is a colourless liquid with a boiling point 118°C. It has a strong vinegar odour and sour taste. The pure acid freezes to an ice like solid at 17 °C, therefore, it is called glacial acetic acid. It is miscible with water, alcoholand ether in all proportions.
13.7.4 Reactions of Acetic Acid
Chemical reactions of acetic acid have already been discussed in the general properties of the carboxylic acids.
13.7.5 Uses of Acetic Acid
Acetic acid is used:i)     as a coagulant for latex in rubber industry.ii)  in the manufacture of plastics (polyvinyl acetate) rayon (cellulose acetate) and silk.
iii)   in medicine as a local irritant.
iv)   as a solvent in the laboratory for carrying out reactions.v)    in the manufacture of pickles.vi)  in the manufacture of many organic compounds like acetone, acetates 
and esters.
13.8 AMINO ACIDS
Amino acids are organic compounds containing both amino and carboxyl groups. They are represented by the general formula:18 19
13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabR is different for different amino acids. The amino group may be present at 
any carbon atom other than that of the carboxyl group ( COOH). They are 
referred to as α, β, γ depending upon whether the amino group is present 
on the α, β, or γ carbon atom relative to the carboxyl group. Almost all the 
naturally occurring amino acids are α  amino acids. These amino acids are 
very important because they are the building blocks of proteins. Proteins are very important for us.
The amino acids which contain two carboxyl groups are called acidic amino acids while those containing two amino groups are called basic amino acids. For example, glutamic acid and aspartic acid are acidic amino acids while lysine is a basic amino acid. 
About twenty amino acids have been identified as the constituents of most of 
the animal and plant proteins.
  
Out of twenty amino acids which are required for protein synthesis, the human body can synthesize only ten. The amino acids which body can synthesize are called non-essential amino acids. The remaining ten amino 
acids which the body is not able to synthesize are called essential amino acids. 13.8.1 Essential and Non-essential Amino Acids
The essential amino acids must be supplied to our bodies 
through our diet because they are required for proper health and growth. The deficiency of essential amino acids may cause diseases.
Although amino acids can be named according to IUPAC system, they are generally known by their trivial names. These trivial names usually reflect the origin or an obvious property of the compound. 13.8.2 Nomenclature of Amino Acids
Glycine, for example is so named, because it has a sweet taste (Greek glykys - sweet) and the tryosine was first isolated from cheese (from Greek tryos-cheese). For the sake of simplicity, each amino acid has been given an abbreviation w’hich generally consists of the first three letters of the common name. For example, the simplest amino acid is glycine H
2NCH2 COOH. It may be 
abbreviated as Gly. Similarly, alanine CH3  CH  COOH may be represented as Ala.
                                                                                                            
                                                                             NH2

13.8.3 Structure of Amino Acids
The amino acids exist as dipolar ion called Zwitter ion. It has positive as well as negative ends within the same molecule. In the formation of Zwitter ion, the proton goes from the carboxyl group to amino group. The Zwitter ionic structure of an amino acid may be written as:20 21
13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 13. CARBOXYLIC ACIDS eLearn.Punjab eLearn.PunjabAnimaton 13.9 : Formation of the peptide bond 
ource & Credit : Researchpeptides
The dipolar structure is also called internal salt. All α- amino acids exist largely 
in dipolar ionic forms.
13.8.4 Acidic and Basic Characters of Amino Acids
1. When an acid is added to an amino acid the carboxylate ion accepts the proton 
and, therefore, the basic character is due to this group.On the basis of dipolar ion structure, the acidic and basic reactions of amino acids
 may be represented as :
2. When an alkali is added to an amino acid,  NH3 group releases the proton 
and therefore the acidic character is due to this group.
When hydrogen cyanide is added to an aldehyde in the presence of ammonia, 
α - amino acid is obtained.13.8.5 Synthesis of Amino Acids
Amino acids can be synthesized by the following reactions.1. By the reaction of 
α - bromoacid with ammonia.
α - amino nitdle upon acidic hydrolysis yields an α - amino acid:

Amino acids react with nitrous acid to produce α - hydroxy carboxylic acid 
and nitrogen gas.2. Reaction with Nitrous Acid
Ninhydrin reacts with amino acid to form an intensely coloured 
bluish violet product. The ninhydrin reaction is also widely used to “visualize’’ amino acids separated by paper chromatography.13.8.7 Test of Amino Acids
Ninhydrin Test
Peptides are the compounds formed by the condensation of two or more same or different a-amino acids. The condensation occurs between amino acids with the elimination of water. In this case, the carboxyl group of one amino acid and amino group of another amino acid gets condensed with elimination of water. The resulting 
 CO  NH  linkage is called a peptide linkage.13.8.8 Peptidos and Proteins
The formation of peptide is shown below:
If a large number of amino acids (hundreds to thousands) are joined by peptide bonds, the resulting polymide is called a polypeptide .
Depending upon the number of amino acids per molecule, the peptides are dipeptides, tripeptides, polypeptides, etc. The formation of peptide bonds can continue until a molecule containing several hundred thousand amino acids is formed. Such a molecule is called polypeptide or protein. By convention 
a peptide having molecular mass upto 10,000 is called a polypeptide while 
a peptide having a molecular mass more than 10,000 is called a protein.
