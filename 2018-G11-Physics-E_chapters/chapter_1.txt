versince man has started to observe, think and reason he has been wondering about
the world around him. He tried to find ways to organize the disorder prevailing in the observed
facts about the natural phenomena and material things in an orderly manner. His attempts
resulted in the birth of a single discipline of science, called natural philosophy. There was a

huge increase in the volume of scientific knowledge up till the
beginning of nineteenth century and it was found necessary
to classify the study of nature into two branches, the
biological sciences which deal with living things and physical
sciences which concern with non-living things. Physics is an
important and basic part of physical sciences besides its
other disciplines such as chemistry, astronomy, geology etc.
Physics is an experimental science and the scientific method

By the end of 19th century many physicists started believing
that every thing about physics has been discovered.
However, about the beginning of the twentieth century many
new experimental facts revealed that the laws formulated by
the previous investigators need modifications. Further
researches gave birth to many new disciplines in physics
such as nuclear physics which deals with atomic nuclei,

The measurement of a base quantity involves two steps: first,
the choice of a standard, and second, the establishment of a
procedure for comparing the quantity to be measured with
the standard so that a number and a unit are determined as
the measure of that quantity.
An ideal standard has two principal characteristics: it is
accessible and it is invariable. These two requirements are
often incompatible and a compromise has to be made
between them.

deals with velocities approaching that of light and solid state
physics which is concerned with the structure and properties
of solids, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
Physics is most fundamental of all sciences and provides
other branches of science, basic principles and fundamental
laws, This overlapping of physics and other fields gave birth
to new branches such as physical chemistry, biophysics,
astrophysics, health physics etc. Physics also plays an
important role in the development of technology and
engineering.

Scientific Notation
Numbers are expressed in standard form called scientific
notation, which employs powers of ten. The internationally
accepted practice is that there should be only one non-
zero digit left of decimal. Thus, the number 134.7 should
be written as 1.347 x 102 and 0.0023 should be expressed
as 2.3 x 10
Conventions for Indicating Units
Use of SI units requires special care, more particularly in
writing prefixes.
Following points should be kept in mind while using units.
(I)
Full name of the unit does not begin with a capital
letter even if named after a scientist e.g.,newton.
5
---

(ii)
The symbol of unit named after a scientist has
initial capital letter such as N for newlon.
(iii)
The prefix should be written before the unit without
any space, such as 1 x 10 m is written as 1 mm.
Standard prefixes are given in table 1.4.

1.4 ERRORS AND UNCERTAINTIES
All physical measurements are uncertain or imprecise to
some extent. It is very difficult to eliminate all possible errors
or uncertainties in a measurement. The error may occur due
to (1) negligence or inexperience of a person (2) the faulty
apparatus (3) inappropriate method or technique. The
uncertainty may occur due to inadequacy or limitation of an
instrument, natural variations of the object being measured
or natural imperfections of a person's senses. However, the
uncertainty is also usually described as an error in a
measurement. There are two major types of errors.
(i) Random error
(ii) Systematic error
Random error is said to occur when repeated
measurements of the quantity, give different values under
6
---

the same conditions. It is due to some unknown causes.
Repeating the measurement several times and taking an
average can reduce the effect of random errors.
Systematic error refers to an effect that influences all
measurements of a particular quantity equally, It produces
a consistent difference in readings. It occurs to some
definite rule. It may occur due to zero error of instruments,
poor calibration of instruments or incorrect markings etc.
Systematic error can be reduced by comparing the
instruments with another which is known to be more
accurate. Thus for systematic error, a correction factor can
be applied.
1.5 SIGNIFICANT FIGURES
As stated earlier physics is based on measurements. But

By applying the above rule the position of the edge of a line
recorded as 12.7 cm with the help of a metre rod calibrated
in millimetres may lie between 12.65 cm and 12.75 cm.
Thus in this example the maximum uncertainty is = 0,05 cm.
It is, in fact, equivalent to an uncertainty of 0.1 cm equal to
the least count of the instrument divided into two parts, half
above and half below the recorded reading.
The uncertainty or accuracy in the value of a measured
quantity can be indicated conveniently by using significant
figures. The recorded value of the length of the straight line

i.e. 12.7 cm contains three digits (1. 2, 7) out of which two
digits (1 and 2) are accurately known while the third digit
i.e. 7 is a doubtful one. As a rule:
In any measurement, the accurately known digits and
the first doubtful digit are called significant figures.

In other words, a significant figure is the one which is
known to be reasonably reliable. If the above mentioned

zeros to the right of a significant figure are
significant. For example, all the zeros in 3.570
or 7.4000 are significant. However, in integers
such as 8,000 kg, the number of significant
zeros is determined by the accuracy of the
measuring instrument. If the measuring scale
has a least count of 1 kg then there are four
significant figures written in scientific notation
8

as 8.000 x 10¬∞ kg. If the least count of the scale
is 10 kg. then the number of significant figures
will be 3 written in scientific notation as
8.00 10 kg and so on.
d) When a measurement is recorded in scientific
notation or standard form, the figures other than
the powers of ten are significant figures.
For example, a measurement recorded as
8.70 x 104 kg has three significant figures.

In multiplying or dividing numbers, keep a number
of significant figures in the product or quotient not
more than that contained in the least accurate
factor i.e., the factor containing the least number of
significant figures. For example, the computation of

is rounded off for which the following rules are followed.
a) If the first digit dropped is less than 5, the last digit
retained should remain unchanged.
b) If the first digit dropped is more than 5. the digit to be
retained, is increased by one.
c)
If the digit to be dropped is 5, the previous digit which
is to be retained is increased by one if it is odd and
retained as such if it is even. For example, the
following numbers are rounded off to three significant
figures as follows. The digits are deleted one by one.

Following this rule, the correct answer of the computation
given in section (ii) is 1,46 X 10 3.
(iii)
In adding or subtracting numbers, the number of
decimal places retained in the answer should equal
the smallest number of decimal places in any of the
quantities being added or subtracted. In this case,
the number of significant figures is not important. It
is the position of decimal that matters. For example,
suppose we wish to add the following quantities
expressed in metres.

Correct answer:

8.13 m
In case (i) the number 72,1 has the smallest number of
decimal places, thus the answer is rounded off to the same
position which is then 75.5 m. In case (ii), the number 4.10 has
the smallest number of decimal places and hence, the answer
is rounded off to the same decimal positions which is
then 8.13m.
1.6 PRECISION AND ACCURACY
In measurements made in physics, the terms precision
and accuracy are frequently used. They should be
distinguished clearly. The precision of a measurement is

percentage uncertainty in that measurement.
For example, when the length of an object is recorded as
25.5 cm by using a metre rod having smallest division in
millimetre, it is the difference of two readings of the initial
and final positions. The uncertainty in the single reading as
discussed before is taken as + 0.05 cm which is now
doubled and is called absolute uncertainty equal to
10.1cm. Absolute uncertainty, in fact, is equal to the least
count of the measuring instrument.
Precision or absolute uncertainty (least count) = + 0.1 cm

more precise instrument, such as micrometre screw

used. Hence, we can conclude that
A precise measurement is the one which has less
absolute uncertainty and an accurate measurement
is the one which has less fractional or percentage
uncertainty or error.
1.7 ASSESSMENT OF TOTAL
UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINAL RESULT
To assess the total uncertainty or error, it is necessary to
evaluate the likely uncertainties in all the factors involved in
that calculation. The maximum possible uncertainty or
error in the final result can be found as follows. The proofs
of these rules are given in Appendix 2.
11
---

1. For addition and subtraction
Absolute uncertainties are added: For example, the
distance x determined by the difference between two
separate position measurements
For your information
x1=10.5 * 0,1 cm and X2 = 26,8 + 0,1 cm is recorded as
X=X2-X = 16.3 + 0.2 cm
2. For multiplication and division
Percentage uncertainties are added. For example the
maximum possible uncertainty in the value of resistance R
of a conductor determined from the measurements of
potential difference V and resulting current flow I by using
R If V/1 is found as follows:
5.2 + 0.1 y

The %age uncertainty for

Hence total uncertainty in the value of resistance R when V
is divided by / is 8% The result is thus quoted as
R = 884 A 6,19 VA = 6.19 ohms with a % age
uncertainty of 8%
that is
R = 6.2 + 0.5 ohms

average value.
(III)
The mean deviation is the uncertainty in the
average value.
For example, the six readings of the micrometer
screw gauge to measure the diameter of a wire in
mm are
1.20,1.22,1.23,1.19,1.22,1.21
13
---

Then
Average = 1.20 + + 1.23 + 1.19 + 1.22
1.22 +1.21

= 1.21 mm
The deviation of the readings, which are the difference
without regards to the sign, between each reading and
average value are 0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.02, 0.01, 0,
Mean of deviations = 0.01+0.01+0.02+0.02+0.01+0

= 0.01 mm
Thus, likely uncertainty in the mean diametre 1.21 mm is
0.01 mm recorded as 1.21 # 0.01 mm.
5. For the uncertainty in a timing experiment
The uncertainty in the time period of a vibrating body is
found by dividing the least count of timing device by the
number of vibrations. For example, the time of 30
vibrations of a simple pendulum recorded by a stopwatch
accurate upto one tenth of a second is 54.6 S, the period

Hence, it is advisable to count large number of swings to
reduce timing uncertainty
Example 1.1: The length, breadth and thickness of a
sheet are 3.233m, 2.105 m and 1.05 cm respectively.
Calculate the volume of the sheet correct upto the
appropriate significant digits.
Solution: Given length / =3.233 m
Breadth b = 2.105m
Thickness h = 1.05cm a 1.05 X 10 m
Volume V =1xbxh
= 3.233m x 2.105m x 1.05 x 10 -2 m
14
---

7.14573825 x 10 m¬≥
As the factor 1,05 cm has minimum number of significant
figures equal to three, therefore, volume is recorded upto 3
significant figures, hence, V = 7.15x10"m

lever balance is 2.2 kg. Two silver coins of masses 10,01 g
and 10.02 g measured by a beam balance are added to it.
What is now the total mass of the box correct upto the
appropriate precision.
Solution: Total mass when silver coins are added to box
=2.2 kg + 0.01001 kg + 0.01002 kg
= 2.22003 kg
For Your Information
Since least precise is 2.2 kg. having one decimal place,
hence total mass should be to one decimal place which is
the appropriate precision. Thus the total mass = 2.2 kg.

1,8 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES
Each base quantity is considered a dimension denoted by
a specific symbol written within square brackets. It stands
for the qualitative nature of the physical quantity. For
example, different quantities such as length, breadth,
diameter, light year which are measured in metre denote
the same dimension and has the dimension of length [L]
Similarly the mass and time dimensions are denoted by
[
M ] and [ T ]. respectively. Other quantities that we
measure have dimension which are combinations of these
dimensions. For example, speed is measured in metres
per second. This will obviously have the dimensions of
length divided by time. Hence we can write.
Dimension of length
Dimensions of speed = Dimension of time
Similarly the dimensions of acceleration are
[a]=[L][T2]=[LT"]
and that of force are
Using the method of dimensions called the dimensional
analysis, we can check the correctness of a given formula
or an equation and can also derive it. Dimensional analysis

makes use of the fact that expression of the dimensions
can be manipulated as algebraic quantities.
(i) Checking the homogeneity of physical equation
In order to check the correctness of an equation, we are to
show that the dimensions of the quantities on both sides of
the equation are the same, irrespective of the form of the
formula. This is called the principle of homogeneity of
dimensions,
Example 1.4: Check the correctness of the relation
where V is the speed of transverse wave on a
m
stretched string of tension F. length / and mass m.
Solution:
Dimensions of L.H.S. of the equation = [v] = [ LT ]
Dimensions of R.H.S. of the equation =([F]x[I]x[m`])"
= X = [ LT `]
Since the dimensions of both sides of the equation are the
same, equation is dimensionally correct.
(ii) Deriving a possible formula
The success of this method for deriving a relation for a
physical quantity depends on the correct guessing of
various factors on which the physical quantity depends.

Example 1.5: Derive a relation for the time period of a
simple pendulum (Fig. 1.2) using dimensional analysis, The
various possible factors on which the time period T may
depend are :
i)
Length of the pendulum (1)
ii)
Mass of the bob (m)
m
iii)
Angle e which the thread makes with the vertical

Solution:
The relation for the time period T will be of the form
Txm"x/"x0'xg
or

where we have to find the values of powers a, b, C and d.
Writing the dimensions of both sides we get
[T] = constant

The numerical value of the constant cannot be determined
by dimensional analysis, however, it can be found by
experiments.

units of coefficient of viscosity 1 in the relation of Stokes'
law for the drag force F for a spherical object of radius /

accounted in dimensional analysis. Then

SUMMARY
Physics is the study of entire Physical World.
The most basic quantities that can be used to describe the Physical World are
mass, length and time. All other quantities, called derived quantities, can be
described in terms of some combinations of the base quantities.
The internationally adopted system of units used by all the scientists and almost all
the countries of the World is International System (SI) of Units. It consists of seven
base units, two supplementary units and a number of derived units.
Errors due to incorrect design or calibrations of the measuring device are called
systematic errors. Random errors are due to unknown causes and fluctuations in
the quantity being measured.
The accuracy of a measurement is the extent to which systematic error make a
measured value differ from its true value.
The accuracy of a measurement can be indicated by the number of significant
figures, or by a stated uncertainty.
The significant figures or digits in a measured or calculated quantity are those
digits that are known to be reasonably reliable.
The result of multiplication or division has no more significant figures than any factor
in the input data. Round off your calculator result to correct number of digits,
in case of addition or subtraction the precision of the result can be only as great as
the least precise term added or subtracted.
Each basic measurable physical property represented by a specific symbol written
within square brackets is called a dimension. All other physical quantities can be
derived as combinations of the basic dimensions.
Equations must be dimensionally consistent. Two terms can be added only when
they have the same dimensions.
