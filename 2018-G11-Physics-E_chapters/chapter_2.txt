2.1 BASIC CONCEPTS OF VECTORS
(i) Vectors
As we have studied in school physics, there are some physical quantities which require
both magnitude and direction for their complete description, such as velocity, acceleration
22

and force. They are called vectors. In books, vectors are
Y
usually denoted by bold face characters such as A, d, r and
V while in handwriting, we put an arrowhead over the letter
e.g. d. If we wish to refer only to the magnitude of a vector di
we use light face type such as d.
x
o
A vector is represented graphically by a directed line
segment with an arrowhead. The length of the line
segment, according to a chosen scale, corresponds to
the magnitude of the vector.
ig.2.1(a)
(ii) Rectangular coordinate system
Two reference lines drawn at right angles to each other
Y
P(a.b)
as shown in Fig. 2.1 (a) are known as coordinate axes and
their point of intersection is known as origin. This system
di
of coordinate axes is called Cartesian or rectangular
b
e
coordinate system.
x
X
o
One of the lines is named as x-axis, and the other the y-
axis. Usually the x-axis is taken as the horizontal axis, with
the positive direction to the right, and the y-axis as the
vertical axis with the positive direction upward.
Y
Fig. (2,1(b)
The direction of a vector in a plane is denoted by the angle
which the representative line of the vector makes with
positive x-axis in the anti-clock wise direction, as shown in
Z
Fig 2.1 (b). The point P shown in Fig 2.1 (b) has
coordinates (a,b). This notation means that if we start at
the origin, we can reach P by moving 'a' units along the
positive x-axis and then 'b' units along the positive y-axis.
o
Y
The direction of a vector in space requires another axis
which is at right angle to both x and y axes, as shown in
Fig 2.2 (a). The third axis is called z-axis,
Fig. 2.2(a)
The direction of a vector in space is specified by the three
angles which the representative line of the vector makes
with x, y and Z axes respectively as shown in Fig 2.2 (b).
12
The point P of a vector A is thus denoted by three
coordinates (a, b, c).
P(a.b.)

(iii) Addition of Vectors
p
o
Given two vectors A and B as shown in Fig 2.3 (a), their sum
Y
is obtained by drawing their representative lines in such a
way that tail of vector B coincides with the head of the vector
x
A. Now if we join the tail of A to the head of B, as shown in
Flg. 2.2(b)
23
---

the Fig. 2.3(b), the line joining the tail of A to the head of B will
A
represent the vector sum (A+B) in magnitude and direction.
The vector sum is also called resultant and is indicated by R.
B
Thus R = A+B. This is known as head to tall rule of vector
addition. This rule can be extended to find the sum of any
Fig. 2.3(a)
number of vectors. Similarly the sum B + A is illustrated by
black lines in Fig 2.3 (c). The answer is same resultant R as
indicated by the red line. Therefore, we can say that
A+B=B+A
(2.1)
B
So the vector addition is said to be commutative. It means
that when vectors are added, the result is the same for any
A
order of addition.
(iv)
Resultant Vector
The resultant of a number of vectors of the same kind-force
Fig. 2.3(b)
vectors for example, is that single vector which would have
the same effect as all the original vectors taken together.
B
(v)
Vector Subtraction
The subtraction of a vector is equivalent to the addition of
A
the same vector with its direction reversed. Thus, to
subtract vector B from vector A, reverse the direction of B
B
and add it to A. as shown in Fig. 2.3 (d).
A B = A + (-B) where (-B) is negative vector of B
Fig. 2.3(c)
(vi) Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
-B
The product of a vector A and a number n > 0 is defined
to be a new vector nA having the same direction as A
but 8 magnitude n times the magnitude of A as
A
illustrated in Fig. 2.4. If the vector is multiplied by a
negative number, then its direction is reversed.
Fig.2.3(d)
In the event that n represents a scalar quantity, the product
nA will correspond to a new physical quantity and the
dimensions of the resulting vector will be the product of the
dimensions of the two quantities which were multiplied
A
2A
together. For example, when velocity is multiplied by scalar
mass m, the product is a new vector quantity called momentum
-2A
having the dimensions as those of mass and velocity,
(vii)
Unit Vector
A unit vector in a given direction is a vector with magnitude
one in that direction. It is used to represent the direction of
Fig. 2,4
a vector.
24

A unit vector in the direction of A is written as A, which we
read as 'A hat', thus
A = AA
o

A=A
(2.2)
x
A
Fig. 2.5(a)
The direction along X, y and z axes are generally
represented by unit vectors I -
and k respectively
(Fig. 2.5 a). The use of unit vectors is not restricted to
Cartesian coordinate system only. Unit vectors may be
defined for any direction. Two of the more frequently
used unit vectors are the vector r which represents the
direction of the vector (Fig. 2.5 b) and the vector n
which represents the direction of a normal drawn on a
specified surface as shown in, Fig 2.5 (c).
(viii) Null Vector
Fig. 2.5(b)
Null vector is a vector of zero magnitude and arbitrary
direction Forekample, the sum of a vector and its negative
vector is a null vector.
A + (-A)=
(2.3)
(ix)
Equal Vectors
A
Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if they have the
same magnitude and direction, regardless of the position
of their initial points,
This means that parallel vectors of the same magnitude
Flg. 2.5(c)
are equal to each other.
(x)
Rectangular Components of a Vector
A component of a vector is its effective value in a given
direction. A vector may be considered as the resultant of
its component vectors along the specified directions, It is
usually convenient to resolve a vector into components
along mutually perpendicular directions. Such components
are called rectangular components.

Thus A, i and A are the components of vector A. Since
these are at right angle to each other, hence, they are called
rectangular components of A. Considering the right angled
triangle OMP, the magnitude of A, I or x-component of A is
A, = A cos
(2.5)
And that of Ay j or y-component of A is
Ay = A sin e

Determination of a Vector from its
Rectangular Components
If the rectangular components of a vector, as shown in
Fig. 2.6, are given, we can find out the magnitude of the
vector by using Pythagorean theorem.

(xii) Position Vector
The position vector r is a vector that describes the location
P(a,b)
of a point with respect to the origin. It is represented by a
straight line drawn in such a way that its tall coincides with
r
the origin and the head with point P (a,b) as shown in
Fig.2.7(a). The projections of position vector r on the x and
y axes are the coordinates a and b and they are the
rectangular components of the vector . Hence

r=al+bj and r==

In three dimensional space, the position vector of a point
P (a,b.c) is shown in Fig. 2.7 (b) and is represented by
Z
r=ai+bj+ck and r=va'+b'+d
(2.10)
P(a.b.c)
Example 2.1: The positions of two aeroplanes at any
r
instant are represented by two points A (2, 3, 4) and
B(5, 6,7) from an origin o in km as shown in Fig. 2.8.

o
Y
(ii) Calculate the distance between the two aeroplanes.
Solution: (i) A position vector r is given by

Thus position vector of first aeroplane A is
DA=21+3j+4k
B
And position vector of the second aeroplane B is
OB =5i+6j+7k
By head and tail rule
OA + AB = 08
A
Therefore, the distance between two aeroplanes is given by
o
AB = OB - OA =
Fig.2.8
=(3i+3j+3k)
Magnitude of vector AB is the distance between the
position of two aeroplanes which is then:
AB = (3km) + (3km)2 + (3km)2 = 5.2km

(2.11)
which means that the sum of the magnitudes of
x-components of two vectors which are to be added, is
equal to the x-component of the resultant. Similarly the
sum of the magnitudes of y-components of two vectors is
equal to the magnitude of y-component of the resultant,
that is
R,=A,+B,
(2.12)
Since R, and R, are the rectangular components of the
resultant vector R, hence
R =R,++R,
or
R=(A,+B,i+(A,+B,))
The magnitude of the resultant vector R is thus given as

2.3 PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS
There are two types of vector multiplications. The product
of these two types are known as scalar product and vector
product. As the name implies, scalar product of two vector
quantities is a scalar quantity. while vector product of two
vector quantities is a vector quantity.

We come across this type of product when we consider the

Characteristics of Scalar Product
1.
Since A.B=AB COS 0 and B.A = BA cose = AB cos e,
hence, A.B = B.A. The order of multiplication is
irrelevant. In other words, scalar product is
commutative.
2.
The scalar product of two mutually perpendicular
vectors is zero. A.B = AB cos90° =0
In case of unit vectors i.j and k, since they are
mutually perpendicular, therefore,

i.j=j.k=k.i=0

3.
The scalar product of two parallel vectors is, equal
to the product of their magnitudes. Thus for parallel
vectors (0=0°)
A.B = AB cos 0°=AB

Examples of Vector Product
i.
When a force F is applied on a rigid body at a
point whose position vector is r from any point
of the axis about which the body rotates, then
the turning effect of the force, called the torque
T is given by the vector product of r and F.
t=rxF
ii.
The force on a particle of charge q and
velocity V in a magnetic field of strength B is
given by vector product,

2.4 TORQUE
We have already studied in school physics that a turning

push harder on the spanner. It also depends on the length

of the spanner: the longer the handle of the spanner, the
o
greater is the turning effect of an applied force. The
turning effect of a force is called its moment or torque and
its magnitude is defined as the product of force F and

(spanner) rotates. This distance OP is called moment
Flg.2.13
arm 1. Thus the magnitude of torque represented by T is
t=IF
(2.26)
36
---

When the line of action of the applied force passes through
the pivot point, the value of moment arm / II 0, so in this case
torque is zero.
We now consider the torque due to a force F acting on
a rigid body. Let the force F acts on rigid body at point
P whose position vector relative to pivot o is . The
F
force F can be resolved into two rectangular
components, F sin 0 perpendicular to r and F cose
along the direction of r (Fig. 2.14 a). The torque due to
F cos about pivot o is zero as its line of action passes
through point O, Therefore, the magnitude of torque due
P
to F is equal to the torque due to F sin 0 only about O.
It is given by
t =(Fsin9)r=rFsin0
(2.27)
Alternatively the moment arm / is equal to the magnitude of
the component of r perpendicular to the line of action of F
Fig. 2.14(a)
as illustrated in Fig. 2.14 (b). Thus
T = (rsin0) F = rF sin e
(2.28)
where e is the angle between r and F
From Eq. 2.27 and Eq. 2.28 it can be seen that the torque
can be defined by the vector product of position vector r
F
and the force F. so
T=rxF
or
t=(rFsine)
(2.29)
Where (rF sin e) is the magnitude of the torque. The
direction of the torque represented by n is perpendicular
to the plane cóntaining r and F given by right hand rule for
Fig. 2.14(b)
the vector product of two vectors.
The SI unit for torque is newton metre (N m),
Just as force determines the linear acceleration produced
in a body, the torque acting on a body determines its angular
acceleration. Torque is the analogous of force for rotational
motion. If the body is at rest or rotating with uniform
angular velocity, the angular acceleration will be zero. In this
case the torque acting on the body will be zero.

2.5 EQUILIBRIUM OF FORCES
We have studied in school physics that if a body, under the
action of a number of forces, is at rest or moving with
uniform velocity, it is said to be in equilibrium.
First Condition of Equilibrium
A body at rest or moving with uniform velocity has zero
acceleration. From Newton's Law of motion the vector sum
of all forces acting on it must be zero.
Stand with one arm and the side of

usually in terms of x and y components of the forces. We
have studied that x-component of the resultant force F
equals the sum of x-directed or x-components of all the
27
forces acting on the body. Hence
EF,=0

Similarly for the -directed forces, the resultant of

2.6 EQUILIBRIUM OF TORQUES
Second Condition of Equilibrium
F
Let two equal and opposite forces act on a rigid
body as shown in Fig. 2.17. Although the first condition of
equilibrium is satisfied, yet it may rotate having clockwise
turning effect. As discussed earlier, for angular acceleration
to be zero, the net torque acting on the body should be
zero. Thus for a body in equilibrium, the vector sum of all
F
the torques acting on it about any arbitrary axis should be
zero. This is known as second condition of equilibrium.
Fig. 2.17
Mathematically it is written as
Et= o
(2.33)
By convention, the counter clockwise torques are taken as
positive and clockwise torques as negative. An axis is
chosen for calculating the torques. The position of the axis
is quite arbitrary. Axis can be chosen anywhere which is
convenient in applying the torque equation. A most helpful
point of rotation is the one through which lines of action of
several forces pass.
We are nowina position to state the complete requirements
for a body to be in equilibrium, which are

and

When 1st condition is satisfied, there is no linear
acceleration and body will be in translational equilibrium.
When 2nd condition is satisfied, there is no angular
acceleration and body will be in rotational equilibrium,
For a body to be in complete equilibrium, both conditions
should be satisfied, i.e., both linear acceleration and

door and try to rise up on your toes.
If a body is at rest, it is said to be in static equilibrium but if
the body is moving with uniform velocity, it is said to be
in dynamic equilibrium.
We will restrict the applications of above mentioned
conditions of equilibrium to situations in which all the forces
lie in a common plane. Such forces are said to be

coplanar. We will also assume that these forces lie in the
xy-plane.
If there are more than one object in equilibrium in a given
problem, one object is selected at a time to apply the

conditions of equilibrium.

point A on the beam as shown in Fig. 2.18?

Solution: We Isolate the diving board which is in

diagram (Fig. 2.20 b). Note that the weight 200 N of the
uniform diving board is shown to act at point C, the centre
of gravity which is taken as the mid-point of the board. R1

and R2 are the reaction forces exerted by the pedestals on
the board. A little consideration will show that R is in the

R3 = =1100 N = - 1.1 kN
Substituting the value of R1 in Eq. (i). we have
-1100 + R = 500
R = 1600 N =1.6 kN
The negative sign of R1 shows that it is directed downward,
Thus the result has corrected the mistake of our initial
assumption.
SUMMARY
The arrangement of mutually perpendicular axes is called rectangular or Cartesian
coordinate system.
A scalar is a quantity that has magnitude only, whereas a vector is a quantity that
has both direction and magnitude.
The sum vector of two or more vectors is called resultant vector.
Graphically the vectors are added by drawing them to a common scale and
placing them head to tail, the vector connecting the tail of the first to the head of
the last vector is the resultant vector.
Vector addition can be carried out by using rectangular components of vectors. If
A, and A, are the rectangular components of A and B, and By are that of vector
B, then the sum R=A+Bis given by
R,=Ax+B,
Ry=Ay+B,
where and direction
Unit vectors describe directions in space. A unit vector has a magnitude of 1 with
no units.
A vector of magnitude zero without any specific direction is called null vector.
The vector that describes the location of a particle with respect to the origin of
coordinate system is known as position vector.
The scalar product of two vectors A and B is a scalar quantity, defined as :
A.B = AB cos e
42
---

The vector product of two vectors A and B is another vector C whose magnitude is
given by :
C = AB sin8
Its direction is perpendicular to the plane of the two vectors being multiplied, as given
by the right hand rule.
A body is said to be in equilibrium under the action of several forces if the body has
zero translational acceleration and no angular acceleration.
For a body to be in translational equilibrium the vector sum of all the forces acting on
the body must be zero,
The torque is defined as the product of the force and the moment arm.
The moment arm is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the
direction of line of action of the force.
For a body to be in rotational equilibrium, the sum of torques on the body about any axis
must be equal to zero.
