state of never ending motion. We move around the Earth's surface, while the Earth moves in
its orbit around the Sun. The Sun and the stars, too, are in motion. Everything in the vastness
of space is in a state of perpetual motion.

Every physical process involves motion of some sort.
Because of its importance in the physical world around us,
it is logical that we should give due attention to the study
of motion.
We already know that motion and rest are relative. Here, in
this chapter, we shall discuss other related topics in some
more details.
3.1 DISPLACEMENT
Whenever a body moves from one position to another,
Y
the change in its position is called displacement The
A

displacement can be represented as a vector that
B
d
describes how far and in what direction the body has been
displaced from its original position. The tail of the
F,
G
displacement vector is located at the position where the
displacement started, and its tip or arrowhead is located at
the final position where the displacement ended. For

example, if a body is moving along a curve as shown in
Fig. 3.1 with A as its initial position and B as its final

position then the displacement d of the body is
represented by AB. Note that although the body is moving
along a curve, the displacement is different from the path(
of motion.
If r is the position vector of A and T2 that of point B then by
head and tail rule it can be seen from the figure that
d=n
The displacement is thus a change in the
position of body from its initial position to its
final position.
Its magnitude is the straight line distance between the

initial position and the final position of the body.

read as limiting value of Ad/At as At approaches zero.
If the instantaneous velocity does not change, the body is
said to be moving with uniform velocity.
3.3 ACCELERATION
If the velocity of an object changes, it is said to be moving
with an acceleration.
The time rate of change of velocity
of a body is called acceleration.
As velocity is a vector so any change in velocity may be

Consider a body whose velocity Vi at any instant t changes to

time interval At is given by

As aav is the difference of two vectors divided by a scalar
At, day must also be a vector. Its direction is the same as
that of AV. Acceleration of a body at a particular instant is
known as instantaneous acceleration and it is the value
obtained from the average acceleration as At is made
smaller and smaller till it approaches zero. Mathematically,
it is expressed as

If the velocity of a body is increasing, its acceleration is
positive but if the velocity is decreasing the acceleration is
negative. If the velocity of the body changes by equal amount
in equal intervals of time, the body is said to have uniform
acceleration. For a body moving with uniform acceleration, its
average acceleration is equal to instantaneous acceleration.

3.4 VELOCITY-TIME GRAPH
Graphs may be used to illustrate the variation of velocity of
an object with time. Such graphs are called velocity-time

graphs. The velocity time graphs of an object making three
Fig.3.4
different journeys along a straight road are shown in
figures 3.4 to 3.6. When the velocity of the car is constant,
its velocity-time graph is a horizontal straight line (Fig 3.4).
When the car moves with constant acceleration, the
velocity-time graph is a straight line which rises the same
height for equal intervals of time (Fig 3.5).
V
The average acceleration of the
car during the interval t is given by
the slope of its velocity-time graph.
V
When the car moves with increasing acceleration, the
velocity-time graph is a curve (Fig 3.6). The point A on the
Fig.3.5
graph corresponds to time 1. The magnitude of the
instantaneous acceleration at this instant is numerically
equal to the slope of the tangent at the point A on the
velocity-time graph of the object as shown in Fig 3.6.
The distance moved by an object can also be determined
by using its velocity-time graph. For example, Fig 3.4
shows that the object moves at constant velocity y for time t.
The distance covered by the object given by Eq. 3.1 is
v x t. This distance can also be found by calculating the
A
area under the velocity-time graph. This area is shown
shaded in Fig 3.4 and is equal to V x t. We now give

straight line, the direction of motion does not change. In
this case all the vectors can be manipulated like scalars. In
such problems, the direction of initial velocity is taken as
positive. A negative sign is assigned to quantities where
direction is opposite to that of initial velocity.
In the absence of air resistance, all objects in free fall near
the surface of the Earth, move towards the Earth with a
uniform acceleration. This acceleration, known as
acceleration due to gravity, is denoted by the letter g and
its average value near the Earth surface is taken as
9.8 ms2 in the downward direction.
The equations for uniformly accelerated motion can also be
applied to free fall motion of the objects by replacing a by g.

Distance covered = average velocity X time = -1vx1
Now we calculate the area under velocity-time graph which
is equal to the area of the triangle shaded in Fig 3.5. Its
value is equal to 1/2 base x height = 1/2 V x t.
Considering the above two examples it is a general
conclusion that
The area between the velocity-time graph
and the time axis is numerically equal to
the distance covered by the object.
Example 3.1: The velocity-time graph of a car moving
on a straight road is shown in Fig 3.7. Describe the motion
of the car and find the distance covered.

Newton's First Law of Motion
A body at rest will remain at rest and a body moving with
uniform velocity will continue to do so unless acted upon by
some unbalanced external force. This is also known as law
of inertia. The property of an object tending to maintain the
state of rest or state of uniform motion is referred to as the
object's inertia. The more inertia, the stronger is this
tendency in the presence of a force. Thus,

3.7 MOMENTUM
We are aware of the fact that moving object possesses a

tries to stop it. The faster the object is travelling, the harder is
to stop it. Similarly, if two objects move with the same
velocity, then it is more difficult to stop the massive of the two.
This quality of the moving body was called the quantity of
motion of the body, by Newton. This term is now called
linear momentum of the body and is defined by the relation.

The SI unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second

the form F = ma, because it can easily be extended to

Let us consider an isolated system. It is a system on which
no external agency exerts any force. For example, the
molecules of a gas enclosed in a glass vessel at constant
temperature constitute an isolated system. The molecules

agency can exert a force on them.

before collision is equal to the total final momentum of the

momentum of the isolated two ball system is zero.
For such a group of objects, if one object within the group

3.8 ELASTIC AND INELASTIC COLLISIONS
When two tennis balls collide then, after collision, they will
rebound with velocities less than the velocities before the
impact. During this process, a portion of K.E is lost, partly
due to friction as the molecules in the ball move past one
another when the balls distort and partly due to its change
into heat and sound energies.
A collision in which the K.E of the system is
not conserved, is called the inelastic collision.
Under certain special conditions no kinetic energy is lost in
the collision.
In the ideal case when no K.E is lost, the
collision is said to be perfectly elastic.

For example, when a hard ball is dropped onto a marble
floor, it rebounds to very nearly the initial height. It looses

We note that, before collision (v, - v 2 is the velocity of
first ball relative to the second ball. Similarly (vi - V2) is the
velocity of the first ball relative to the second ball after
collision. It means that relative velocities before and after
the collision has the same magnitude but are reversed
after the collision. In other words, the magnitude of relative
velocity of approach is equal to the magnitude of relative
velocity of separation.

Thus force can be calculated from the product of mass of
water striking normally per second and change in velocity.
Suppose the water flows out from a pipe at 3 kgst and its
velocity changes from 5 ms' to zero on striking the ball, then,
Force = 3 kgs1 x (5 mis 1 - 0) = 15kgms2 = 15 N
Example 3.6: A hose pipe ejects water at a speed of
0.3 ms through a hole of area 50 cm2 If the water strikes a
wall normally, calculate the force on the wall, assuming the
velocity of the water normal to the wall is zero after striking.
Solution:
[The
volume of water per
0.005 x0.3m = 0.0015 m³
second striking the wall
Mass per second striking the wall = volume x density
= 0.0015 m² X 1000 kgm =1.5kg
Velocity change of water on striking the wall=0.3ms1-0=0.3ms
Force = Momentum change per second
= 1.5 kgs x 0.3 ms 1 = 0.45 kgms2 = 0.45 N
3.10 MOMENTUM AND EXPLOSIVE
FORCES
There are many examples where momentum changes are
produced by explosive forces within an isolated system
For example, when a shell explodes in mid-air, its
fragments fly off in different directions. The total
momentum of all its fragments equals the initial momentum
my
of the shell. Suppose a falling bomb explodes into two
pieces as shown in Fig. 3.14. The momenta of the bomb
fragments combine by vector addition equal to the original
momentum of the falling bomb.
mv
Consider another example of bullet of mass m fired from a
rifle of mass M with a velocity v. Initially, the total
momentum of the bullet and rifle is zero. From the principle
Fig. 3.14
of conservation of linear momentum, when the bullet is
fired, the total momentum of bullet and rifle still remains
zero, since no external force has acted on them. Thus if v'
is the velocity of the rifle then
64
---

my (bullet) + Mv (rifle) = 0
Mv = - mv
or
(3.20)
M
The momentum of the rifle is thus equal and opposite to
that of the bullet. Since mass of rifle is much greater than
the bullet, it follows that the rifle moves back or recoils with
only a fraction of the velocity of the bullet.
3.11 ROCKET PROPULSION
Rockets move by expelling burning gas through engines at
their rear. The ignited fuel turns to a high pressure gas
which is expelled with extremely high velocity from the
rocket engines (Fig. 3,15). The rocket gains momentum
equal to the momentum of the gas expelled from the engine
but in opposite direction. The rocket engines continue to
expel gases after the rocket has begun moving and hence

where very little or no air is present In order to provide enough
upward thrust to overcome gravity, a typical rocket
consumes about 10000 kgst of fuel and ejects the burnt
gases at speeds of over 4000ms In fact, more than
80% of the launch mass of a rocket consists of fuel only.
One way to overcome the problem of mass of fuel is to
make the rocket from several rockets linked together.
When one rocket has done its job, it is discarded leaving
others to carry the space craft further upat ever greater speed.

rocket is burned and ejected, the mass M of rocket
decreases and hence the acceleration increases,
3.12 PROJECTILE MOTION
Uptill now we have been studying the motion of a particle
along a straight line i.e. motion in one dimension. Now we
consider the motion of a ball, when it is thrown horizontally

from certain height. It is observed that the ball travels forward
as well as falls downwards, until it strikes something
Suppose that the ball leaves the hand of the thrower at point

direction, unless a horizontally directed force acts on the ball.

ball is simple. The ball moves with constant horizontal

velocity component. Hence horizontal distance x is given by
=V,xt
(3.22)
The vertical motion of the ball is also not complicated, It
will accelerate downward under the force of gravity and
hence a = g. This vertical motion is the same as for a
freely falling body. Since initial vertical velocity is zero,
hence, vertical distance y, using Eq. 3.7, is given by
x=1st
It is not necessary that an object should be thrown with
some initial velocity in the horizontal direction. A football
kicked off by a player; a ball thrown by a cricketer and a
missile fired from a launching pad, all projected at some
angles with the horizontal, are called projectiles.
Projectile motion is two dimensional motion
under constant acceleration due to gravity.
66

In such cases, the motion of a projectile can be studied
Y
easily by resolving it into horizontal and vertical
components which are independent of each other.
Suppose that a projectile is fired in a direction angle 0 with
the horizontal by velocity Vi as shown in Fig. 3.16 (b). Let

directions be V) COS e and V1 sin e respectively. The horizontal

resistance and no other force is acting along this direction
lg.2.15(b)
whereas vertical acceleration a, = g. Hence, the horizontal
component V remains constant and at any time i, we have
(3.23)
Now we consider the vertical motion. The initial vertical
component of the velocity is V sin 0 in the upward direction.
Using Eq. 3.5 the vertical component Vly of the velocity at any
instant I is given by
(3.24)
Interesting Information
The magnitude of velocity at any instant is

The angle o which this resultant velocity makes with the
horizontal can be found from

(3.26)
In projectile motion one may wish to determine the height
to which the projectile rises, the time of flight and horizontal
range. These are described below.
Height of the Projectile

In order to determine the maximum height the projectile

attains, we use the equation of motion
that allows one ball to drop freely

S=height=h
So

or

(3.27)
Time of Flight
The time taken by the body to cover the distance from the
place of its projection to the place where it hits the ground
at the same level is called the time of flight.
This can be obtained by taking S=h=0, because the
body goes up and comes back to same level, thus
covering no vertical distance. If the body is projecting with
velocity V making angle 0 with a horizontal, then its vertical
component will be visine. Hence the equation is

at an angle of 30° and from the
other at 601. Why are the ranges
Range of the Projectile
equal?
Maximum distance which a projectile covers in the
horizontal direction is called the range of the projectile.
To determine the range R of the projectile, we multiply the
horizontal component of the velocity of projection with total
time taken by the body after leaving the point of projection.
Thus
R=Vuxt
using Eq. 3.28
R=VjCG80x2vjsin0

But, 2 sin e cos 0 = sin2 e, thus the range of the projectile
depends upon the velocity of projection and the angle of
projection.
Therefore,

For the range R to be maximum, the factor sin20 should
have maximum value which is 1 when 20 = 90° or 0 = 45°
Application to Ballistic Missiles
A ballistic flight is that in which a projectile is given an initial
push and is then allowed to move freely due to inertia and
under the action of gravity, An un-powered and un-guided
missile is called a ballistic missile and the path followed by
it is called ballistic trajectory.
Do You Know ?
As discussed before, a ballistic missile moves in a way that is
the result of the superposition of two independent motions: a
straight line inertial flight in the direction of the launch and a
vertical gravity fall. By law of inertia, an object should sail
straight off in the direction thrown, at constant speed equal to
30°
its initial speed particularly in empty space. But the downward
force of gravity will alter straight path into a curved trajectory.
Range
For short ranges and flat Earth approximation, the trajectory

the range both will be less. When the

horizontal as well as vertical motions. Therefore, it is
completely unrealistic to neglect the aerodynamic forces.
The shooting of a missile on a selected distant spot is a
major element of warfare. It undergoes complicated
motions due to air friction and wind etc. Consequently the
angle of projection can not be found by the geometry of the
situation at the moment of launching. The actual flights of
missiles are worked out to high degrees of precision and
the result were contained in tabular form. The modified
equation of trajectory is too complicated to be discussed
here. The ballistic missiles are useful only for short ranges.
For long ranges and greater precision, powered and
remote control guided missiles are used.

SUMMARY
Displacement is the change in the position of a body from its initial position to its
final position.
Average velocity is the average rate at which displacement vector changes with
time.
Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a particular instant of time. When the
time interval, over which the average velocity is measured, approaches zero, the
average velocity becomes equal to the instantaneous velocity at that instant.
Ad
Average acceleration is the ratio of the change in velocity Av that occurs within
time interval A to that time interval.
71
---

Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration at a particular instant of time. It is the
value obtained from the average acceleration as time interval of is made smaller
and smaller, approaching zero.
W
0
M
The slope of velocity-time graph at any instant represents the instantaneous
acceleration at that time.
The area between velocity-time graph and the time axis is numerically equal to the
distance covered by the object.
Freely falling is a body moving under the influence of gravity alone.
Acceleration due to gravity near the Earth surface is 9.8 ms2 if air friction is ignored.
Equations of uniformly accelerated motion are
(1) v,=v,+al
(iii)
v?=v? +2aS
Newton's laws of motion
1st Law: The velocity of an object will be constant if net force on it is zero,
2nd Law: An object gains momentum in the direction of applied force, and the rate of
change of momentum is proportional to the magnitude of the force.
3rd Law: When two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite force on each
other for the same length of time, and so receive equal and opposite impulses,
The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity.
The impulse provided by a force is the product of force and time for which it acts. It
equals change in momentum of the object.
For any isolated system, the total momentum remains constant. The momentum of
all bodies in a system add upto the same total momentum at all time.
Elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy. In inelastic collision,
some of the energy is transferred by heating and dissipative forces such as friction,
air resistance and viscosity, so increasing the internal energy of nearby objects.
Projectile motion is the motion of particle that is thrown with an initial velocity and then
moves under the action of gravity.
