have studied velocity, acceleration and the laws of motion, mostly as they are
involved in rectilinear motion. However, many objects move in circular paths and their
direction is continually changing. Since velocity is a vector quantity, this change of direction
means that their velocities are not constant. Astone whired around by a string, a car turning
around a corner and satellites in orbits around the Earth are all examples of this kind of
motion.

In this chapter we will study, circular motion, rotational

motion, moment of inertia, angular momentum and the
related topics.
5.1 ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT
Consider the motion of a single particle P of mass m in B
circular path of radius 6 Suppose this motion is taking place
by attaching the particle P at the end of a massless rigid rod
of length , whose other end is pivoted at the centre o of the
circular path, as shown in Fig. 5.1 (a). As the particle is
E
moving on the circular path, the rod OP rotates in the plane
of the circle. The axis of rotation passes through the pivot o
and is normal to the plane of rotation. Consider a system of
axes as shown in Fig. 5.1 (b). The z-axis is taken along the
o
A
y
axis of rotation with the pivot o as origin of coordinates
Axes x and y are taken in the plane of rotation. While OP is
rotating, suppose at any instant I. its position is OP making

angle 0 with x-axis. At later time 1 * M. let its position be
OP, making angle 0+ All with x-axis (Fig. 5.1c).

The angular displacement AB is assigned a positive sign

slow a body is rotating, If is determined by its angular
velocity which is defined as the rate at which the angular

Eq.5.3 would also be a vector, Its direction is along the axis
of rotation and is given by right hand rule as described earlier.
Angular velocity is measured in radians per second which is
its Si unit Sometimes If is also given in terms of revolution
per minute.
5.3 ANGULAR ACCELERATION
When we switch on an electric fan, we notice that its
angular velocity goes on increasing We say that it has an
angular acceleration. We define angular acceleration as
the rate of change of angular velocity, If and (1) are the

The angular acceleration is also a vector quantity whose

magnitude is given by Eq. 5.5 and whose direction is along
the axis of rotation. Angular acceleration is expressed in
units of rad s:
Till now we have been considering the motion of a particle
P on a circular path. The point P was fixed at the end of a
rotating massless rigid rod. Now we consider the rotation
Fly 5.1
of a rigid body as shown in Fig. 5.3. Imagine a point P on
the rigid body Line OP is the perpendicular dropped from
P on the axis of rotation. It is usually referred as reference
line. As the body rotates, line OP also rotates with it with
the same angular velocity and angular acceleration. Thus
the rotation of a rigid body can be described by the rotation
of the reference line OP and all the terms that we defined
with the help of rotating line OP are also valid for the
rotational motion of a rigid body. In future while dealing
102

with rotation of rigid body, we will replace it by its reference
line OP.
5.4 RELATION BETWEEN ANGULAR
AND LINEAR VELOCITIES
Consider a rigid body rotating about z-axis with an angular
i
velocity m as shown in Fig. 5.4 (a).
C

Imagine a point P in the rigid body at a perpendicular
distance r from the axis of rotation. OP represents the
o
reference line of the rigid body, As the body rotates, the
point P moves along a circle of radius / with a linear
velocity y whereas the line OP rotates with angular velocity
in as shown in Fig. 5,4 (b) We are interested in finding out
to 14th
the relation between U and v. As the axis of rotation is
fixed, so the direction of to always remains the same and
a can be manipulated as a scalar. As regards the linear
velocity of the point P we consider its magnitude only
which can also be treated as a scalar,
Suppose during the course of its motion. the point P moves
through a distance P,P, = is in a time interval at during
which reference line OP has an angular displacement se

In Fig 5,4 (b), it can be seen that the point P is moving
Fig $480
along the are PP. In the limit when At D, the length of
arc P,P: becomes very small and its direction represents
the direction of tangent to the circle at point P. Thus the
velocity with which point P is moving on the circumférence
103

of the circle has a magnitude y and its direction is always along
the tangent to the circle at that point. That is why the linear
velocity of the point P is also known as tangential velocity.
Point to Ponder
Similarly Eq 5.7 shows that if the reference line OP is
rotating with an angular acceleration a the point P will also
have a linear or tangential acceleration in. Using Eq 5.7 it
can be shown that the two accelerations are related by

Equations Of Angular Motion
The equations (5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5) of angular motion are
exactly analogous to those in linear motion except that 0,
to and a have replaced S V and a, respectively. As the
other equations of linear motion were obtained by
algebraic manipulation of these equations, it follows that
analogous equations will also apply to angular motion.

Direction of motion changes

5.5 CENTRIPETAL FORCE
The motion of a particle which is constrained to move in 8
circular path is quite interesting. It has direct bearing on the
motion of such things as artificial and natural satellites,
nuclear particles in accelerators, bodies whirling at the
ends of the strings and flywheels spinning on the shafts,
F
We all know that a ball whirled in a horizontal circle at the
end of a string would not continue in a circular path if the
string is snapped, Caraful observation shows at once that
if the string snaps, when the ball is at the point A, in
Fig. 5.5 (b), the ball will follow the straight line path AB.
The fact is that unless a string or some other mechanism
Flg 5.5(a)
pulls the ball towards the centre of the circle with a force,
as shown in Fig. 5.5 (a), ball will not continue along the
circular path.
B
The force needed to bend the normally
straight path of the particle into a circular
F
path is called the centripetal force.
If the particle moves from A to B with uniform speed y as
A
shown in Fig. 5.6 (a), the velocity of the particle changes its
direction but not its magnitude The change in velocity is
shownin Fig. 5.6 (b). Hence, the acceleration of the particle is

Let us now draw a triangle POR such that PO is parallel
and equal to V1 and PR is parallel and equal to Mr. as
fig 5/6(a)
shown in Fig. 5.6 (b). We know that the radius of a circle is
perpendicular to its tangent, so OA is perpencicular to Vi
and OB is perpendicular to v (Fig. 5.6 a). Therefore, angle
AOB equals the angle QPR between VI and Vs. Further, as
V1 = V2 = V and OA = OB, both triangles are isosceles.

If the point B is close to the point A on the circle, as will be the

Fig. 5.6 (a) and (b), since PQ is perpendicular to OA and PR
is perpendicular to OB, so QR is perpendicular to AB. It may
be noted that OR is parallel to the perpendicular bisector of
AB. As the acceleration of the object moving in the circle is
106

directed along radius towards the contro of the circle. It can.
therefore, be concluded that

Solution: For the ball to travel in a circle, the force
acting on the ball must provide the required centripotal
force. In this case, at point A, two forces act on the ball, the
Flo E
pull of the string and the weight W of the ball. These forces
act along the radius at A and so their vector sum must
furnish the required centripetal force. We, therefore, have

5.7 ANGULAR MOMENTUM
We have already seen that linear momentum plays an
important role in translational motion of bodies. Similarly,
another quantity known as angular momentum has
important role in the study of rotational motion.

momentum about a reference axis if it

changes relative to that reference axis.

The angular momentum L of a particle of mass m moving

origin o is defined as

Where / is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the
axis of rotation.
Physicists usually make a distinction between spin angular
A'
momentum (La) and orbital angular momentum (b.o.)
The spin angular momentum is the angular momentum of
a spinning body, while orbital angular momentum is
associated with the motion of a body along a circular path.
The difference is illustrated in Fig. 5.12. in the usual
circumstances concerning orbital angular momentum, the
orbital radius is large as compared to the size of the body.
hence, the body may be considered to be a point object.
Example 5.4: The mass of Earth is 6.00 X 10 kg. The
distance F from Earth to the Sun is 1,50 x 10" m. As seen
in
from the direction of the North Star, the Earth revolves
counter-clockwise around the Sun. Determine the orbital
angular momentum of the Earth about the Sun, assuming
that it traverses a circular orbit about the Sun once a year

Solution: To find the Earth's orbital angular momentum
we must first know its orbital speed from the given data.

5.8 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF
ANGULAR MOMENTUM
The law of conservation of angular momentum states that
if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular
momentum of the system remains constant,
Fig. 513
Lau -Li+4 + constant
Aman diving from a diving brant
The law of conservation of angular momentum is one of
the fundamental principles of Physics. It has been verified
from the cosmological to the submicroscopic level. The
effect of the law of conservation of angular momentum is
readily apparent if a single isolated spinning body alters its
moment of inertia. This is illustrated by the diver in
Fig.513 The diver pushes off the board with a small angular

velocity about a horizontal axis through his centre of
gravity. Upon lifting all from the board, the diver's legs
and arms are fully extended which means that the diver
has a large moment of inertia la about this axis. The
moment of inertia is considerably reduced to a new value
is when the legs end arms are drawn into the closed tuck
position. As the angular momentum is conserved, so

Hence, the diver must spin faster when moment of inertia
becomes smaller to conserve angular momentum. This
enables the diver to take extra somersaults.

This fact is of great importance for the Earth as it moves
around the Sun. No other sizeable torque is experienced by
the Earth, because the major force acting on it is the pull of
the Sun. The Earth's axis of rotation, therefore, remains fixed
in one direction with reference to the universe around us.

If, however, a satellite in a circular orbit is at an appreciable
distance h above the Earth's surface, we must take into
account the experimental fact that the gravitational
acceleration decreases inversely as the square of the
distance from the centre of the Earth (Fig. 5.16).
The higher the satellite, the slower will the required speed
and longer it will take to complete one revolution around
the Earth.
Close orbiting satellites orbit the Earth at a height of about
400 km. Twenty four such satellites form the Global

by the weight? The real weight of an object is the
gravitational pull of the Earth on the object. Similarly the
weight of an object on the surface of the Moon is taken to
be the gravitational pull of the Moon on the object.
Generally the weight of an object is measured by a spring
balance. The force exerted by the object on the scale is
116
---

equal to the pull due to gravity on the object, i.e., the
weight of the object, This is not always true, as will be
explained a little later, so we call the reading of the scale
as apparent weight
To illustrate this point, lot US consider the apparent weight
of an object of mass m, suspended by a string and spring
balance, in a lift as shown in Fig. 5.17 (a), When the lift is
at rest, Newton's second law tells us that the acceleration
of the object is zero, the resultant force on it is also zero. If
W is the gravitational force acting on it and T is the tension
in the string then we have,

T-w=ma
As
a=0
hence,
T=W
(5.26)

This situation will remain so long as a = 0. The scale thus
shows the real weight of the object. The weight of the

required to stop it from falling in that frame of reference.
5,12 WEIGHTLESSNESS IN SATELLITES
AND GRAVITY FREE SYSTEM
When a satellite is falling freely in space, everything within
this freely falling system will appear to be weightless. it does
not matter where the object is, whether it is falling under the
force of attraction of the Earth, the Sun, or some distant star.
An Earth's satellite is freely falling object The statement
may be surprising at first, but it is easily seen to be correct.
Consider the behaviour of a projectile shot parallel to the
horizontal surface of the Earth in the absence of air friction.
Lane
If the projectile is thrown at successively larger speeds,
spid
then during its free fall to the Earth, the curvature of the
path decreases with increasing horizontal speeds. If the
object is thrown fast enough parallel to the Earth, the
curvature of ils path will match the curvature of the Earth
as shown in Fig. 5.18. In this case the space ship will
simply circle round the Earth.
The space ship is accelerating towards the centre of the
Earth at all times since it circles round the Earth its radial
acceleration is simply g. the free fall acceleration. In fact.
Pip 5.18
the space ship is failing towards the centre of the Earth at
all the times but due to spherical shape of the Earth, 4
never strikes the surface of the Earth. Since the space
ship is in free fall, all the objects within it appear to be
weightless. Thus no force is required to hold an object
falling in the frame of reference of the space craft or
satellite Such a system is called gravity free system.

5.13 ORBITAL VELOCITY
The Earth and some other planets revolve round the Sun
in nearly circular paths. The artificial safellites launched by
men also adopt nearly circular course around the Earth.
This type of motion is called orbital motion

circular path. The mass of the satellite is mg and M is its
orbital speed. The mass of the Earth is M and represents
the radius of the orbit A centripetal force marin is required

5.14 ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY
In a gravity free space satellite there will be no force that
will force any body to any side of the spacecraft. If this
satellite is to stay in orbit over an extended period of time,
this weightlessness may affect the performance of the
astronauts present in that spacecraft To over come this
difficulty, an artificial gravity is created in the spacecraft
This could enable the crew of the space ships to function
in an almost normal manner. For this situation to prevail,
the space ship is set into rotation around its own axis. The
Fly 5.20
astronaut then is pressed towards the outer rim and exerts
a force on the "floor" of the spaceship in much the same
way as on the Earth.
Consider a spacecraft of the shape as shown in Fig. 5.20.

around its own contral axis with angular speed (0). then its

retransmit the signals is provided by large solar cell panels
fitted on the satellites. There are over 200 Earth stations
which transmit signals to satellites and receive signals via
satellites from other countries. You can also pick up the
signal from the satellite using a dish antenna on your house

we might think of space BE a thin rubber sheet; if 8 heavy

bodies and light rays move along geodesics (equivalent to
straight lines in plane geometry) in curved space time.
Thus, a body at rest or moving slowly near the great mass

Einstein inferred that if gravitational acceleration and
inertial acceleration are precisely equivalent, gravity must
bend light, by a precise amount that could be calculated.
This was not entirely a startling suggestion: Newton's
theory, based on the idea of light as a stream of tiny
particles, also suggested that a light beam would be
deflected by gravity But in Einstein's theory, the
deflection of light is predicted to be exactly twice as
great as it is according to Newton's theory. When the
bending of starlight caused by the gravity of the Sun
was measured during a solar eclipse in 1919, and found to
match Einstein's prediction rather than Newton's, then
Einstein's theory was hailed as a scientific triumph,

The force needed to move a body around a circular path is called centripetal force
and is calculated by the expression
Moment of inertia is the rotational analogue of mass in linear motion. It depends on
the mass and the distribution of mass from the axis of rotation.
Angular momentum is the analogue of linear momentum and is defined as the
product of moment of inertia and angular velocity.
Total angular momentum of all the bodies in a system remains constant in the
absence of an external torque.
Artificial satellites are the objects that orbit around the Earth due to gravity
Orbital velocity is the tangential velocity to put a satellite in orbit around the Earth.
Artificial gravity is the gravity like effect produced in an orbiting spaceship to
overcome weightlessness by spinning the spaceship about its own axis
Geo-stationary satallité is the one whose orbital motion is synchronized with the
rotation of the Earth.
Albert Einstein viewed gravitation as a space-time curvature around an object.
