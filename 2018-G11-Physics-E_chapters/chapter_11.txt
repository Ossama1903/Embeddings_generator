hermodynamics deals with various phenomena of
energy and related properties of matter, especially the
transformation of heat into other forms of energy. An example
of such transformation is the process converting heat into
mechanical work. Thermodynamics thus plays central role in
technology, since almost all the raw energy available for our
use is liberated in the form of heat. In this chapter we shall
study the behaviour of gases and laws of thermodynamics,
their significance and applications.
11.1 KINETIC THEORY OF GASES
The behavior of gases is well accounted for by the kinetic
theory based on microscopic approach. Evidence in favour
of the theory is exhibited in diffusion of gases and
Brownian motion of smoke particles etc.
The following postulates help to formulate a mathematical
model of gases.
i.
A finite volume of gas consists of very large
number of molecules.
ii.
The size of the molecules is much smaller than
the separation between molecules.
III.
The gas molecules are in random motion and
may change their direction of motion after every
collision.
iv.
Collision between gas molecules themselves
and with walls of container are assumed to be
perfectly elastic.
V.
Mólecules do not exert force on each other
except during a collision.
Pressure of Gas
According to kinetic theory, the pressure exerted by a gas
is merely the momentum transferred to the walls of the
container per second per unit area due to the continuous
collisions of molecules of the gas. An expression for the
pressure exerted by a gas can, therefore, be obtained as
follows:

So the number of collisions per second that the molecule
will make with this face is =
Thus the rate of change of momentum of the molecule due
to collisions with face ABCDA /
The rate of change of momentum of the molecule is equal
to the force applied by the wall. According to Newton's
third law of motion, force Fix exerted by the molecule on
face ABCDA is equal but opposite, so
Similarly the forces due to all other molecules can be

molecules are supposed to be moving randomly, the mean
square of all the component velocities will be equal. Hence

where N. is the number of molecules per unit volume.
Thus,
P= Constant <K.E.>
or
P x <K.E.>
While deriving the equation for pressure we have not
accounted rotational and vibrational motion of molecules
except the linear motion.
Hence pressure exerted by the gas is directly proportional
to the average translational kinetic energy of the gas
molecules.
Interpretation of Temperature
From experimental data the ideal gas law is deduced to be
PV=nRT
(11.6)
Where n is the number of moles of the gas contained in
volume V at absolute temperature T and R is called
universal gas constant, Its value is 8.314 J mor' K'
If NA is the Avogadro number, then the above equation can
be written as

This relation shows that Absolute temperature of an ideal
gas is directly proportional to the average translational
kinetic energy of gas molecules.
We can, therefore, also say that average translational
kinetic energy of the gas molecules shows itself
macroscopically in the form of temperature.
Derivation of Gas Laws
(i) Boyle's Law
From kinetic theory of gases (Eq. 11.5)
If we keep the temperature constant, average K.E. i.e.,
< 1/2 mv > remains constant, so the right hand side of the
equation is constant.
Hence
PV=Constant
or
Thus pressure P is inversely proportional to volume V at
constant temperature of the gas which is Boyle's law.
(ii) Charles' Law
Equation 11.5 can be written as
If pressure is kept constant

As

Hence

Thus volume is directly proportional to absolute
temperature of the gas provided pressure is kept constant.
This is known as Charles' law.

11.2 INTERNAL ENERGY
Do You Know?
The sum of all forms of molecular energies (kinetic and
Rotation
potential) of a substance is termed as its internal energy. In
the study of thermodynamics, usually ideal gas is
considered as a working substance. The molecules of an

ideal gas are mere mass points which exert no forces on
one another. So the internal energy of an ideal gas system
is generally the translational K.E. of its molecules. Since
the temperature of a system is defined as the average K.E.
of its molecules, thus for an ideal gas system, the Internal
energy is directly proportional to its temperature.

between atorns.
It is important to note that energy can be added to a
system even though no heat transfer takes place. For
example, when two objects are rubbed together, their
internal energy increases because of mechanical work.
The increase in temperature of the object is an indication
of increase in the internal energy. Similarly, when an object
slides over any surface and comes to rest because of
frictional forces, the mechanical work done on or by the
system is partially converted into internal energy.
In thermodynamics, internal energy is a function of state.
Consequently, it does not depend on path but depends on
initial and final states of the system. Consider a system which
undergoes a pressure and volume change from P, and Va to
Pb. and Vb respectively, regardless of the process by which

energy by some means. The idea was first applied to the
steam engine where it was natural to pump heat in and
Fig. 11,2
get work out. Consequently it made a sense to define both
heat in and work out as positive quantities, Hence work
done by the system on its environment is considered tive
while work done on the system by the environment is taken
as -ive. If an amount of heat Q enters the system it could
manifest itself as either an increase in internal energy or as
a resulting quantity of work performed by the system on
the surrounding or both.
We can express the work in terms of directly measurable
variables. Consider the gas enclosed in the cylinder with a
moveable, frictionless piston of cross-sectional area A (Fig.
11.3 a). In equilibrium the system occupies volume V, and
exerts a pressure P on the walls of the cylinder and its

work on the air, thereby, increasing its internal energy,
which is shown, by the increase in temperature of the air.

transforming processes that occur within an organism are
named as metabolism. We can apply the first law of
thermodynamics,
AU=Q-V
to an organism of the human body. Work (W) done will
result in the decrease in internal energy of the body.
Consequently the body temperature or in other words
Internal energy is maintained by the food we eat.
Example 11.3: A gas is enclosed in a container fitted
with a piston of cross-sectional area 0,10 m². The pressure
of the gas is maintained at 8000 Nm2. When heat is slowly
transferred, the piston is pushed up through a distance of
4.0 cm. If 42 J heat is transferred to the system during the
expansion, what is the change in internal energy of the
system?
Solution:
The work done by the gas is
PAAy = 8000 Nm 2 x 0,10 m 2 x 4.0 x 102 m
32Nm = 32 J
The change in internal energy is found from first law of
thermodynamics,
AU=Q-W=42J-32J - = 10 J
Isothermal Process

---

In case of an ideal gas, the P.E. associated with its
molecules is zero, hence, the internal energy of an ideal
gas depends only on its temperature, which in this case
remains constant, therefore, AU=0. Hence, the first
law of thermodynamics reduces to
Q=W
Thus if gas expands and does external work W, an amount
of heat o has to be supplied to the gas in order to produce
an isothermal change. Since transfer of heat from one place
to another requires time, hence, to keep the temperature of
the gas constant, the expansion or compression must take
place slowly. The curve representing an isothermal process
is called an isotherm (Fig. 11.6a).
Adiabatic Process
An adiabatic process is the one in which no heat enters or
leaves the system. Therefore, Q = 0 and the first law of
thermodynamics gives
W=-AU
Thus if the gas expands and does external work, it is done
at the expense of the internal energy of its molecules and,
hence, the temperature of the gas falls. Conversely an
adiabatic compression causes the temperature of the gas to
rise because of the work done on the gas.
Adiabatic change occurs when the gas expands or is
compressed rapidly, particularly when the gas is contained
in an insulated cylinder. The examples of adiabatic
processes are

In case of adiabatic changes it has been seen that
PV T = Constant
248
---

where, Y is the ratio of the molar specific heat of the gas at
constant pressure to molar specific heat at constant volume.
The curve representing an adiabatic process is called an
adiabat (Fig. 11.6 b).
11.5 MOLAR SPECIFIC HEATS OF A GAS
One kilogram of different substances contain different
number of molecules. Sometimes it is preferred to consider
a quantity called a mole, since one mole of any substance
contains the same number of molecules. The molar
specific heat of the substance is defined as the heat
required to raise the temperature of one mole of the
substance through 1 K. In case of solids and liquids the
change of volume and hence work done against external
pressure during a change of temperature is negligibly
small. But same can not be said about gases which suffer
variation in pressure as well as in volume with the rise in
temperature. Hence, to study the effect of heating the
gases, either pressure or volume is kept constant. Thus, it
is customary to define the molar specific heats of a gas in
two ways.
(i)
The molar specific heat at constant volume is the
amount of heat transfer required to raise the
temperature of one mole of the gas through 1 K at
constant volume and is symbolized by C.
If 1 mole of an ideal gas is heated at constant volume
so that its temperature rises by AT, the heat
transferred Q, must be equal to C, AT Because
AV = 0, no work is done (Fig 11.7. a). Applying first
law of thermodynamics,
Q,=AU+W
Hence,
C, AT = AU + 0

temperature of one mole of the gas through 1 K at
constant pressure and it is represented by symbol
Cp To raise the temperature of 1 mole of the gas
by AT at constant pressure. the heat transfer Qp
must be equal to Cp AT (Fig 11.7 b), Thus,
249
---

Qp =C.AT
(11.12)
Derivation of
When one mole of a gas is heated at constant pressure, the
internal energy increases by the same amount as at
constant volume for the same rise in temperature AT. Thus
from Eq. 11.11
AU = C, 2 AT
Since the gas expands to keep the pressure constant, so it
does work W=P AV, where AV is the increase in volume.
Substituting the values of heat transfer Qp. internal energy
AU and the work done W in Eq.1 11.10, we get
C,AT = C,AT+PAV
(11.13)
Using equation 11.6 for one mole of an ideal gas,
PV=RT
(11.14)
At constant pressure P, amount of work done by one mole
of a gas due to expansion AV (Fig. 11.7 b) caused by the
rise in temperature AT is given by Eq. 11.14
PAV=RAT
Substituting for PAV in Eq. 11.13
or
Co=C,+
or
Cp - C,=R
(11.15)
It is obvious from Eq. 11.15 that Cp > C, by an amount
equal to universal gas constant R.
11.6 REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE
PROCESSES
A reversible process is one which can be retraced in
exactly reverse order, without producing any change in the
surroundings. In the reverse process, the working
substance passes through the same stages as in the direct
process but thermal and mechanical effects at each stage
are exactly reversed. If heat is absorbed in the direct
250
---

process, it will be given out in the reverse process and if
work is done by the substance in the direct process, work
will be done on the substance in the reverse process.
Hence, the working substance is restored to its original
conditions.
A succession of events which bring the system
back to its Initial condition is called a cycle. A
reversible cycle is the one in which all the
changes are reversible.
Although no actual change is completely reversible but the
processes of liquefaction and evaporation of a substance,
performed slowly, are practically reversible. Similarly the

process.
All changes which occur suddenly or which involve friction
or dissipation of energy through conduction, convection or
radiation are irreversible. An example of highly irreversible
process is an explosion.
11.7 HEAT ENGINE
A heat engine converts some thermal energy to
mechanical work. Usually the heat comes from the burning
of a fuel. The earliest heat engine was the steam engine. It
was developed on the fact that when water is boiled in a
vessel covered with a lid, the steam inside tries to push the
lid off showing the ability to do work. This observation
helped to develop a steam engine.
251
---

Basically à heat engine (Fig. 11.8) consists of hot reservoir
or source which can supply heat at high temperature and a
cold reservoir or sink into which heat is rejected at a lower
temperature. A working substance is needed which can
absorb heat Q, from source, converts some of it into work
W by its expansion and rejects the rest heat Q2 to the cold
reservoir or sink. A heat engine is made cyclic to provide
a continuous supply of work.
11.8 SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
Hot reserves
First law of thermodynamics tells us that heat energy can
be converted into equivalent amount of work, but it is silent
about the conditions under which this conversion takes
place. The second law is concerned with the
circumstances in which heat can be converted into work
and direction of flow of heat.

W Q1 - Q2
In practice, the petrol engine of a motor car extracts heat
from the burning fuel and converts a fraction of this energy
to mechanical energy or work and expels the rest to
atmosphere. It has been observed that petrol engines
convert roughly 25% and diesel engines 35 to 40%
available heat energy into work.
The second law of thermodynamics is a formal statement
based on these observations. It can be stated in a number of
different ways.

According to Lord Kelvin's statement based on the working
of a heat engine
It is impossible to devise a process which

11.9 CARNOT ENGINE AND CARNOT'S

Sadi Carnot in 1840 described an ideal engine using only
isothermal and adiabatic processes, He showed that a
heat engine operating in an ideal reversible cycle between
two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, would be the
most efficient engine, A Carnot cycle using an ideal gas as
the working substance is shown on PV diagram (Fig. 11.9).

4. Finally the gas is compressed adiabatically to restore
its initial state at temperature T1. The process is
represented by curve DA.
Thermal and mechanical equilibrium is maintained all the
time so that each process is perfectly reversible. As the
working substance returns to the initial state, there is no
change in its internal energy i.e. AU=0.
The net work done during one cycle equals to the area
enclosed by the path ABCDA of the PV diagram. It can
also be estimated from net heat Q absorbed in one cycle.

The efficiency is usually taken in percentage, in that case,
percentage efficiency =
Thus the efficiency of Carnot engine depends on the
temperature of hot and cold reservoirs. It is independent of
the nature of working substance. The larger the
254
---

temperature difference of two reservoirs, the greater is the
efficiency. But it can never be one or 100% unless cold
reservoir is at absolute zero temperature (T2 = OK).
Such reservoirs are not available and hence the maximum
efficiency is always less than one. Nevertheless the Carnot
cycle establishes an upper limit on the efficiency of all heat
engines. No practical heat engine can be perfectly
reversible and also energy dissipation is inevitable. This
fact is stated in Carnot's theorem
No heat engine can be more efficient than a Carnot
engine operating between the same two temperatures.

undergoes four successive processes in each cycle.

1.
The cycle starts on the intake stroke in which piston
moves outward and petrol air mixture is drawn through
an inlet valve into the cylinder from the carburetor at
atmospheric pressure.
2. On the compression stroke, the inlet valve is closed and

the mixture is compressed adiabatically by inward
movement of the piston.
3.
On the power stroke, a spark fires the mixture causing a
rapid increase in pressure and temperature, The burning
mixture expands adiabatically and forces the piston to
move outward. This is the stroke which delivers power to
crank shaft to drive the flywheels.

The cycle then begins again. Most motorbikes have one
cylinder engine but cars usually have four cylinders on the
same crankshaft (Fig 11.10 b). The cylinders are timed to fire
turn by turn in succession for a smooth running of the car. The
actual efficiency of properly tuned engine is usually not more
than 25% to 30% because of friction and other heat losses.

11.12 ENTROPY
Cylinder
The concept of entropy was introduced into the study of
thermodynamics by Rudolph Clausius in 1856 to give a
quantitative basis for the second law. It provides another
variable to describe the state of a system to go along with
pressure, volume, temperature and internal energy. If a
system undergoes a reversible process during which it
absorbs a quantity of heat AQ at absolute temperature T,
Fig. 11,11
then the increase in the state variable called entropy S of
the system is given by
AS =
(11.19)
257
---

Like potential energy or internal energy, it is the change in
entropy of the system which is important.
Change in entropy is positive when heat is added and
negative when heat is removed from the system. Suppose,
an amount of heat Q flows from a reservoir at temperature
T1 through a conducting rod to a reservoir at temperature
T2 when T1 > T2. The change in entropy of the reservoir, at
temperature T1. which loses heat, decreases by Q/T1 and
of the reservoir at temperature T2, which gains heat,
increases by Q/T2. As T1 > T2 so Q/T2 will be greater than
Q/T, i.e. Q/T2>Q/T,
Hence, net change in entropy= is
positive.
It follows that in all natural processes where heat flows
from one system to another, there is always a net increase
in entropy. This is another statement of 2nd law of
thermodynamics. According to this law
If a system undergoes a natural process, it will
go in the direction that causes the entropy of
the system plus the environment to increase.
It is observed that a natural process tends to proceed
towards a state of greater disorder. Thus, there is a
relation between entropy and molecular disorder. For
example an irreversible heat flow from a hot to a cold
substance of a system increases disorder because the
molecules are initially sorted out in hotter and cooler
regions. This order is lost when the system comes to
thermal equilibrium. Addition of heat to a system increases
its disorder because of increase in average molecular
speeds and therefore, the randomness of molecular
motion. Similarly, free expansion of gas increases its
disorder because the molecules have greater randomness
of position after expansion than before. Thus in both
examples, entropy is said to be increased.
We can conclude that only those processes are probable
for which entropy of the system increases or remains
constant. The process for which entropy remains constant
is a reversible process; whereas for all irreversible
processes, entropy of the system increases.
258
---

Every time entropy increases, the opportunity to convert
some heat into work is lost. For example there is an increase
in entropy when hot and cold waters are mixed. Then warm
water which results cannot be separated into a hot layer and
a cold layer, There has been no loss of energy but some of
the energy is no longer available for conversion into work.
Therefore, increase in entropy means degradation of energy
from a higher level where more work can be extracted to a
lower level at which less or no useful work can be done. The
energy in a sense is degraded, going from more orderly form
to less orderly form, eventually ending up as thermal energy.

11.13 ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS AS
ENTROPY CRISIS
The second law of thermodynamics provides us the key for
both understanding our environmental crisis, and for
understanding how we must deal with this crisis.
From a human standpoint the environmental crisis results
from our attempts to order nature for our comforts
and greed, From a physical standpoint, however, the
environmental crisis is an entropy or disorder crisis
resulting from our futile efforts to ignore the second law of
thermodynamics. According to which, any increase in the
order in a system will produce an even greater increase in
entropy or disorder in the environment. An individual
impact may not have a major consequence but an impact
of large number of all individuals disorder producing

The energy processes we use are not very efficient. As a
result most of the energy is lost as heat to the environment.

great concern. Even small temperature changes in the
environment can have significant effects on metabolic rates in
plants and animals. This can cause serious disruption of the
overall ecological balance.
In addition to thermal pollution, the most energy
transformation processes such as heat engines used for
transportation and for power generation cause air pollution.
In effect, all forms of energy production have some
undesirable effects and in some cases all problems can
not be anticipated in advance.
The imperative from thermodynamics is that whenever you
do anything, be sure to take into account its present and
possible future impact on your environment. This is an
ecological imperative that we must consider now if we are
to prevent a drastic degradation of life on our beautiful but
fragile Earth.

Standard Definitions of Base Units
Metre: The unit of length is named as metre. Before 1960 it was defined as the distance
between two lines marked on the bar of an alloy of platinum (90%) and iridium (10%) kept under
controlled conditions at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France. The 11°
General Conference on Weights and Measures (1960) redefined the standard metre as follows:
One metre is a length equal to 1,650,763.73 wave lengths in vacuum of the orange red radiation
emitted by the Krypton 86-atom. However, in 1983 the metre was redefined to be the distance
traveled by light in vacuum during a time of 1/299,792.458 second. In effect, this latest definition
establishes that the speed of light in vacuum is 299,792,458 mg"
Kilogram: The unit of mass is known as kilogram. It is defined as the mass of a platinum (90%)
and iridium (10%) alloy cylinder, 3.9 cm in diameter and 3.9 cm in height, kept at the International
Bureau of Weights and Measures in France. This mass standard was established in 1901.
Second: The unit of time is termed as second, It is defined as 1/86400 part of an average day of the
year 1900 A.D. The recent time standard is based on the spinning motion of electrons in atoms. This is
since 1967 when the International Committee on Weights and Measures adopted a new definition of
second, making one second equal to the duration in which the outer most electron of the cesium-133
atom makes 9,192,631,770 vibrations.
Kelvin: Temperature is regarded as a thermodynamic quantity, because its equality
determines the thermal equilibrium between two systems. The unit of temperature is kelvin. It is
the fraction 1/273,16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. It should be
noted that the triple point of a substance means the temperature at which solid, liquid and vapour
phases are in equilibrium. The triple point of water is taken as 27316 K. This standard was
adopted in 1967.
Ampere: The unit of electric current is ampere. It is that constant current which if maintained in
two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section and placed a
metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 107 newton per
metre of length. This unit was established in 1971.
Candela: The unit of luminous intensity is candela. It is defined as the luminous intensity in the
perpendicular direction of a surface of 1/600000 square metre of a black body radiator at the
solidification temperature of platinum under standard atmospheric pressure, This definition was
adopted by the 13th General Conference of Weights and measures in 1967.
Mole: The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary
entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon 12 (adopted in 1971). When this unit i.e. mole is
used, the elementary entities must be specified; these may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons,
other particles or specified groups of such particles. One mole of any substance contains
6.0225 x 1023 entities.

Possible Error in A Compound Quantity
(i)
ERROR IN THE COMPOUND QUANTITY z=x+y
If
the errors in the quantities X and y are Ax and Ay respectively, the possible sum is then;
The maximum possible error is when we have
x+Ax+y+4y
or
x-Ax+y-4y
Hence, the quantity can be expressed as
x+y=(Ax+4y)
i.e., the errors are added.
Hence,
error in Z = error in x + error in y
(A 2.1)
(ii)
ERROR IN THE COMPOUND QUANTITY z=xy
If the errors in the quantities x and y are AX and Ay respectively, the compound
quantity could be as large as (x+Ax) (y + Ay) or as small as (x-Ax) (y - 4y). The product is
thus between about xy+ Ay + yAx +Ax Ay and xy x Ay - yAx +Ax Ay: If we neglect Ax Ay,
as being small, then the error is between
and -(x Ay+yax)
or
+ (x Ay + yax)
The possible fractional error is thus
=
xy = + Ay y + AX x
which is the sum of possible fractional errors. Since the fractional error is generally
written as percentage error, hence the possible percentage error is the sum of the
percentage errors for the product of the two physical quantities.
i.e.,
% error in Z = % error in x + % error in y
(A 2.2)

(III) ERROR IN THE COMPOUND QUANTITY z=kx"y"
Let Z, x and y be the numerical values of the physical quantities and k be a constant.
Taking log of both sides;
log 2 = log k + b
Differentiating:
dx b dy y
Multiply by 100
d2 dz 100 = a RX dx 100 + b dy 100
If dx, dy and dz represent the errors in the quantities X, y, and z respectively, then

Error or Uncertainty from Graphs
To find uncertainty In an average value obtained by plotting graphs, the first step is to
draw best straight line through the plotted points using a transparent rüler. The best
straight line passes through as many of plotted points as possible or which leaves
almost an equal distribution of points on either side of the line. The second step is to
pivot a transparent ruler about the centre of best straight line to draw greatest and least
possible slopes, If slope of best straight line is m and greatest and least slopes are m
and m2 as illustrated in Fig. A 2.1. then evaluate m, - m and m2 - m which ever of these is
