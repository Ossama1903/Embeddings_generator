aves transport energy without transporting matter,
The energy transportation is carried by a disturbance, which
spreads out from a source. We are well familiar with different
types of waves such as water waves in the ocean, or gently
formed ripples on a still pond due to rain drop. When a
musician plucks a guitar-string, sound waves are generated
which on reaching our ear, produce the sensation of music.
Wave disturbances may also come in a concentrated bundle
like the shock waves from an aeroplane flying at supersonic
speed Whatever may be the nature of waves, the
mechanism by which it transports energy is the same. A
succession of oscillatory motions are always involved. The
wave is generated by an oscillation in the vibrating body and
propagation of wave through space is by means of
oscillations. The waves which propagate by the oscillation of
material particles are known as mechanical waves
Do You Know?
There is another class of waves which instead of material
particles, propagate out in space due to oscillations of

mechanical waves
So far we have been considering motion of individual
particles but in case of mechanical waves, we study the
collective motion of particles. An example will help us
here. If you look at u black and white picture in a
newspaper with II magnifying glass, you will discover that
the picture is made up of many closely spaced dots. If you
do not use the magnifier. you do not see the duts. What.you
sec is the collective effect of dots in the form of a picture.
Thus what we see as mechanical wave is actually the effect
of oscillations of a very large number of particles of the
medium through which the wave is passing,

PROGRESSIVE WAVES
Drop a pebble into water. Ripples will be produced and
spread out across the water. The ripples are the examples
of progressive waves because they carry energy across
162
---

the water surface A wave, which transfers energy by
moving away from the source of disturbance, is called a
progressive or travelling wave There are two kinds of
progressive waves ⑉ transverse waves and longitudinal
waves
Transverse and Longitudinal Waves
Consider two persons holding opposite ends of a rope or a
hosepipe. Suddenlyone person gives one up and down jerk to
the rope. This disturbs the rope and creates a hump in it which
travelsalong the rope towards the other person (Fig. B.1 a & b)
(a)
(b)
(c)
Fig.R.T
When this hump reaches the other person, it causes his
hand to move up (Fig. 8:1 c). Thus the energy and
momentum imported to the end of the rope by the first
person has reached the other end of the rope by travelling
through the rope i.e., a wave has been set up on the rope
in the form of a moving hump. We call this type of wave a
pulse. The forward motion of the pulse from one end of the
rope to the other is an example of progressive wave. The
hand jerking the end of the rope is the source of the
wave. The rope is the medium in which the wave moves.

A large and loose spring coil (slinky spring) can be used to
demonstrate the effect of the motion of the source in

If the end of the spring is moved back and forth, along the
direction of the spring itsell as shown in Fig. 8.2 (b) a wave
with back and forth displacement will travel along the spring
Waves like those in Fig. B.2 (a) in which displacamento the
spring is perpendicular to the direction of the waves are
called transverse waves Waves like those in Fig. 82 (b) in
Lorgestical were
which displacements are in the direction of propegation of
waves are called longitudinal waves In this example the coil
of spring is the medium, so in general we can say that
Fig 1204
Transverso waves are those in which particles of
the medium are displaced in a direction
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of
waves and longitudinal waves are those in which
the particles of the medium have displacements
along the direction of propagation of waves:
Both types of waves can be set up in solids. In fluids,
however, transverse waves die out very quickly and
usually cannot be produced at all. That is why, sound
waves in air are longitudinal in nature,
8.2 PERIODIC WAVES
Upto now we have considered wave in the form of a pulse
which is set up by a single disturbance in a medium like the
snapping of one end of a rope or a coil spring Continuous,
regular and rhythmic disturbances in a medium result from
periodic vibrations of a source which cause periodic waves
in that medium A good example of a periodic vibrator is an
oscillating mass-spring system (Fig 8.3 a). We have already
studied in the previous chapter that the mass of such a

system executés SHM.

Transverse Periodic Waves
Imagine an experiment where one and of a robe to fastened
to a mass spring vibrator As the mass vibrates up and
down. we observe A transverse periodic wave travelling
along the length of rooe (Fig. 8.3 b) The wave consists of
crests and troughs. The crest is is pattern in which the rope
is displaced above its equilibrium position, and in troughs,
il has a displacement below lbs equilibrium position.
A1
As the source exactles harmonic motion up and down with
amplitude A and frequency / ideally every point along the
length of the rope executes SHM in lum. with the same
amplitude and frequency The wave travels towards right
Fly
as creats and troughts in turn, replace one another, but the
points on the rope simply escillates up and down. The
ampiltudo of the werve in the maximum value of the
displacement in a crest or trough and it is equal to the
amplitude of the vibrator. The distance between any two
consecutive crests or troughts is the same all along the
length of the rope This distance is called the wavelength
1=0
of the periodic wave and is usually denoted by the Greek
letter lambda A (Fig 8,3 b).
in principle, the speed of the wave can be measured by
7

timing the motion of Il wave crest over a measured
distance But it is not always convenient to observe the
motion of the crest: As discussed below however, the
speed of II periodic wave can be found indirectly from its
1
frequency and wavelength.
2
As a wave progresses, each point in the medium oscillates
periodically with the frequency and period of the source.
Fig. 8.4 illustrates a periodic Arive moving to the right, as it
might look in photographic snapshots taken every 1/4
period. Follow the progress of the creat that started out
from the extreme left at i = 0. The time that this crest takes
to move a distance of one wavelength is equal to the time
in
required for a point in the medium to go through one

All parts of the wave pattern move with the same speed, so
the speed of any one crest is just the speed of the wave
We can therefore, say that the speed V of the waves is

same as the frequency of the vibrator. generating the
waves. Thus Eq. 8.1 becomes

The profile of periodic waves generated by a source
executing SHM is represented by a sine curve. Figure 8.5
shows the snapshot of a periodic wave passing through a
D
medium. In this figure, set of points are shown which are
moving in unison as the periodic wave passes. The points
Fig 8.5
C and Cr. as they move up and down, are always in the
same state of vibration i.e., they always have identical
displacements and velocities. Alternatively, we can say that
as the wave passes, the points C ad C' move in phase.
We may also say that C: leads C by one time period or 2s
radian. Any point at a distance x, C lags behind by phase
angle
p=255
So is the case with points D and D' Indeed there are
infinitely many such points along the medium which are
vibrating in phase. Points separated from one another
through distances of A. 2x. 32,
are all in phase with
each other Thése points can be anywhere along the wave
and need not correspond with only the highest and lowest
points. For example, points such as P. P' # P"
are all in phase, Each is separated from the next by a
distance A.
Some of the points are exactly out of step. For example,
when point C reaches its maximum upward displacement,
at the same time D reaches ils maximum downward
displacement. At the instant that C begins to go down, D
begins to move up. Points such as these are called one
half period out of phase, Any two points separated from
one another by 1.32.51
are out of phase.

Longitudinal Periodic Waves
In the previous section we have considered the generation
of transverse periodic waves Now we will see how the
longitudinal periódio waves can be generated
Consider a coll of spring as shown in Fig. 8.6. It is
suspended by threads so that it can vibrate harizontally,
Suppose an oscillating force F is applied to its end as
/
indicated. The force will alternately stretch and compress
the spring, thereby sending a series of stretched regions
31
(called rarefaction) and compressions down the spring We
will see the osciliating force causes a longitudinal wave to
move down the spring This type of wave generated in
springs is also called fl compressional wave. Clearly in a
compressional wave, the particles in the path of wave move
back and forth along the line of propagation of the wave.
Notice in Fig 8.6, the supporting threads would be exactly
vertical if the spring were undisturbed. The disturbance
passing down the spring causes displacements of the
elements of the spring from their equilibrium positions. In
Fig. 8.6. the displacements of the thread from the vertical
are a direct measure of the displacements of the spring

elastic modulus for air, Newton assumed that when a
sound wave traveis through air, the temperature of the air
during compression remains constant and pressure
changes from P to (P+AP) and therefore, the volume

On substituting the values of atmospheric pressure and

whereas its experimental value is 332 me
To account for this difference, Laplace pointed out that the
compressiona and rarefactions occur 50 rapidly that heat of
compressions remains confined to the region where il is
generated and does not have time to flow to the
neighbouring cooler regions which have undergone an
expansion. Hence the temperature of the medium does not
remain constant. In such case Boyle's law takes the form

Effect of Variation of Pressure, Density and
Temperature on the Speed of Sound in a Gas
1. Effect of Pressure:
Since density is proportional
to the pressure, the speed of sound is not affected by a
variation in the pressure of the gas
2. Effect of Density: At the same temperature and
pressure for the gases having the same value of 7, the
speed is inversely proportional to the square root of
their densities Eq. 8.7. Thus the speed of sound in
hydrogen is four times its speed in oxygen as density
of oxygen is 16 times that of hydrogen.
3. Effect of Temperature: When a gas is heated at
constant pressure, its volume is increased and hence
its density is decreased. As

---

An audio generator. Since the two speakers are driven from
the same generator, they vibrate in phase, Such sources of
waves are called coherent sources, A microphone attached
to a sensitive cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) acts as a
detector of sound waves. The CRO is a device to display
the input signal into waveform on its screen. The
microphone is placed at various points, turn by turn, in
front of the loud speakers as shown in the Fig. 8.8 (b).
MM
At points P. P2 and P3 a large signal is seen on the CRO
[Fig. 8.8(c)], whereas at points P2 and P. no signal is
displayed on CRO screen (Fig. 8.B (d)] This effect is
explained in Fig. 8.8 (b) in which compressions and
carefactions are alternately emitted by both speakers.
Continuous lines show compression and dotted lines
show carefactions. At points P. P, and P. we find that

Similarly at points P and Ps, path difference is zero and -2
respectively,
Whenever path difference 16 an integral multiple of

called constructive interference.

Tuning forks give out pure notes (single frequency). If two
tubing forks A and B of the same frequency say 32Hz are
(x)
sounded separately, they will give out pure notes. If they are
sounded simultaneously, it will be difficult to differentiate the
notes of one tuning fork from that of the other The sound
un
waves of the two will be superposed on each other and will
be heard by the human ear as a single pure note If the
tuning fork B in loaded with some wax or plasticene, its
III
frequency will be lowered slightly. say it becomes 30Hz.
If now the two tuning forks are sounded together, a nots of
alternately increasing and decreasing intensity will be heard

This note is called beat note or a beat which is due to

from a tuning fork A Similarly Fig. 8.9 (b) shows the
waveform of the note emitted by tuning fork B: When both
the tuning forks A and B are sounded together, the résultant
waveform is shown in Fig. B.9 (c).
Fig. 8.9 (c) shows how does the beat note occur. At some instant
x the displacement of the two waves is in the same direction.
The resultant displacement is large and a loud sound is heard.

After 1/4 s the displacement of the wave due to one tuning fork
is opposite to the displacement of the wave due to the other
tuning fork resulting in a minimum displacement at Y, hence.
taint sound or no sound is heard.
Another 1/4 in later the displacements are again in the
same direction and a loud sound is heard again at z
This means a loud sound is heard two times in each
second. As the difference of the frequency of the two
tuning forks is also 2 Hz so, we find that
Number of beats per second is equal to the difference
between the frequencies of the tuning forks.
When the difference between the frequencies of the two
sounds is more than about 10 Hz. then it becomes difficult
to recognize the beats
One can use beats to tune a string instrument, such as piano
or violin, by besting a note against a note of known frequency.
The string can then be adjusted to the desired frequency by
lighteningior looseningi untilno beats are heard
Example 8.2: A tuning fork A produces 4 beats per
second with another turning fork B. It is found that by
loading B with some wax, the beat frequency increases to
6 beats per second if the frequency of A is 320 Hz.
determine the frequency of B when loaded
Solution: Since the beat frequency is 4, the frequency
of B is either 320 + 4 = 324 Hz or 320 - 4 = 316 Hz. By
loading B, its frequency will decrease. Thus if 324 Hz is the
original frequency, the beat frequency will reduce On the
other hand. If it is 316 Hz, the beat frequency will increase
which is the case So, the original frequency of the tuning
fork B is 316 Hz and when loaded, it is 316 - 2 = 314 Hz.
8.7 REFLECTION OF WAVES
In an extensive medium. a wave travels in all directions
from its source with a velocity depending upon the
properties of the medium. However, when the weve comes
176
---

across the boundary of two media, a part of it is reflected
back. The reflected wave has the same wevelength and
frequency but its phase may change depending upon the
nature of the boundary.
Now we will discuss two most common cases of reflection
at the boundary. These cases will be explained with the
A
help of waves travelling in slinky spring, (A slinky spring is
a loose spring which has small initial length but a relatively
large extended length).
One end of the slinky spring is tied to a rigid support on a
smooth horizontal table. When B sharp jerk is givenup to the
free end of the slinky spring towards the side A D
displacement or a crest will travel from free end to the
boundary (Fig. 8.10 a) It will exert B force on bound end
towards the side A Since this end is rigidly bound and acts
as a denser medium, it will exert a reaction force on the
#
spring in opposite direction. This force will produce
Fig. I.1E
displacement downwards B and a trough will travel
backwards along the spring (Fig 8.10 b).
From the above discussion it can be concluded that
whenever a transverse wave. travelling in a rarer medium,
encounters a denser medium, it bounces back such that the
direction of its displacement is reversed An incident crest
on reflection becomes a trough.
This experiment is repeated with a little variation by attaching
one end of a light string to any slinky spring and the other end to
the rigid support as shown in Fig. 8.11 If now the spring is
A
given a sharp jerk towards A. a crest travels along the spring
Blany
light string
as shown in Fig. 8,11. When this crest reaches the spring-
string boundary, it exert a force on the string towards the side
A. Since the string has a small mass as compared to spring,
is does not oppose the motion of the spring. The end of the
spring. therefore, continues its displacement towards A The
spring behaves as if it has been plucked up. In other words 8
A
crest is again created at the boundary of the spring-string
system, which travels backwards along the spring From this
it can be concluded that when a transverse wave travelling in
Fig. ILES
a densar medium, is reflected from the boundary of a rarer

8.8 STATIONARY WAVES
Now let us consider the superposition of two waves
moving along a string in opposite directions. Fig. 8.12
(a,b) shows the profile of two such waves at Instants
t=0.7/4, 3/4T and T. where T is the time period of the
wave. We are interested in finding out the displacements
of the points 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 at these Instants as the
waves superpose From the Fig. 8.12 (a,b), it is obvious

principle of superposition. Fig 8.12 (c) shows the
resultant displacement of the points 1,3,5 and 7 at the
instants If = 0. 7/4, T/2. 37/4 and T. It can be seen that
the resultant displacement of these points is always
zero. These points of the medium are known as nodes
Fig. 8.12 (c) shows that the distance between two
178
---

consecutive nodes is 1212 Fig. 8.12 (d) shows the
resultant displacement of the points 2,4 and 6 at the
instants i = o, 714, T12, 3714 and T. The figure shows
that these points are moving with an amplitude which is
the sum of the amplitudes of the component waves.
These points are known BS antinodes. They are situated
midway between the nodes and are also 1/2 apart. The
distance between a node and the next antinode is 1/4,
Such a pattern of nodes and anti-nodes is known as a
stationary or standing wave
Energy in a wave moves because of the motion of the
particles of the medium. The nodes always remain at rest,
so energy cannot flow past these points. Hence energy
remains "standing" in the medium between nodes,
although it alternates between potential and kinetic forms.
When the antinodes are all at their extreme displacements,
the energy stored is wholly potential and when they are
simultaneously passing through their equilibrium positions,
the energy is wholly kinetic,
An easy way to generate a stationary wave is to superpose
a wave travelling down a string with its reflection travelling
in opposite direction as explained in the next section
8.9 STATIONARY WAVES IN A STRETCHED
STRING
Consider a string of length / which is kept stretched by
clamping its ends so that the tension in the string is F. If
the string is plucked at its middle point, two transverse
waves will originale from this point. One of them will move
towards the left end of the string and the other towards the
right end When these waves reach the two clamped ends,
they are reflected back thus giving rise to stationary waves
As the two ends of the string are clamped, no motion will
take place there So nodes will be formed at the two ends
and one mode of vibration of the string will be as shown in
a
Fig. 8.13 with the two ends as nodés with one antinode in

where A, is the wavelength of the waves set up in this
mode,
The speed V of the waves in the string depends upon the
tension F of the string and m. the mass per unit length of
the string. It is given by
V=VF
(8.15)
Knowing the speed V and wavelength Ag the frequency f,

If the same string is plucked from one quarter of its length,
again stationary waves will be set up with nodes and
fig.8.14
antinodes as shown in Fig. 8.14. Note that now the string
vibrates in two loops. This particular configuration of nodes
and antinodes has developed because the string was
plocked from the position of an antinode. As the distance
between two consecutive nodes is half the wavelength, so
the Fig. 8.14 shows that the length / of string is equal to
the wavelength of the waves set up in this mode. If his the
measure of wavelength of these waves. then,
421
(8.18)
A comparison of this equation with Eq. 8.14 shows the
wavelength in this case is half of that in the first case.
Eq. 8.16 shows that the speed of waves depends upon the
tension and mass per unit length of the string. If is
independent of the point from where the string is plucked
to generate the waves. So the speed V of the waves will
be same in two cases:
If 6 is frequency of vibration of string in its second mode,
then by Eq. 8.2

Comparing it with Eq. 8.16, we get

becomes double than when it vibrates in one loop.
At
Similarly by plucking the string property, It can be made to
⑆⑉
vibrate in 3 loops, with nodes and antinodes as shown in
Fig. 8.15.
Fig. 515
In this case the frequency of waves will be fg = 3 fj and the
wavelength will be equal to 2//3. Thus we can say that if the
string is made to vibrate in n loops, the frequency of
stationary waves set up on the string will be
6=06
(8.20)
and the wavelength
(8.21)
It is clear that BS the string vibrates in more and more
loops, its frequency goes on increasing and the
wavelength gets correspondingly shorter. However the
product of the frequency and wavelength is always equal
to v. the speed of waves.
The above discussion, clearly establishes that the
stationary waves have a discreto set of frequencies fu. 27.

nf, which is known as harmonic series. The
fundamental frequency fi corresponds to the first harmonic,
the frequency 6=21 corresponds to the second harmonic
and so on. The stationary waves can be set up on the
string only with the frequencies of harmonic series
determined by the tension, length and mass per unit length
of the string. Waves not in harmonic series are quickly
damped out
The frequency of a string on a musical instrument can be
changed either by varying the tension or by changing the
length. For example, the tension in guitar and violin strings is
varied by lightening the pegs on the neck of the instrument.
Once the instrument is luned, the musicians vary the
frequency by moving their fingers along the neck, thereby
changing the length of the vibrating portion of the string.

8,11 DOPPLER EFFECT
An important phenomenon observed in waves is the
Doppler effect. This effect shows that if there is some
relative motion between the source of waves and the
observer, an apparent change in frequency of the waves is
observed.
This effect was observed by Johann Doppler while he was
observing the frequency of light emitted from distant stars.
In some cases, the frequency of light emitted from a star
was found to be slightly different from that omitted from a
similar source on the Earth. He found that the change in
184
---

frequency of light depends on the motion of star relative to
the Earth.
This effect can be observed with sound waves also. When

pitch of the whistle becomes lower.

calculated easily if the relative motion between the source

Stars moving towards the Earth show a blue shift. This is
because the wavelength of light emitted by the star are

SUMMARY
Waves carry energy and this energy is carried out by a disturbance, which spreads
out from the source:
If the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation of
the wave. then such weve is called transverse wave, e.g. light waves
if the particle of the medium vibrato parallel to the direction of propagation of the
wave, then such wave is called longitudinal wave, e.g. sound waves.
If a particle of the medium is simultaneously acted upon by two weves, then the
resultant displacement of the particle is the algebraic sum of their individual
displacements This is called principle of superposition
When two waves meet each other in a medium then at some points they
reinforce the effect of each other and at some other points they cancel each other's
effect This phenomenon is called interference
The periodic variations of sound between maximum and minimum loudness are
called beats.
Stationary waves are produced in a medium, when two identical waves travelling in
opposite directions interfere in that medium
The apparent change in the pitch of sound caused by the relative motion of either the
source of sound or the listener is called Doppler effect.
