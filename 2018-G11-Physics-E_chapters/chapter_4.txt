W
ork is often thought in terms of physical or mental effort. In Physics, however, the term
work involves two things (i) force (ii) displacement. We shall begin with a simple situation in
which work is done by a constant force.
4.1 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE
Lei us consider an object which is being pulled by a constant force F al an angle 0 to the
direction of motion. The force displaces the object from position A to B through a
displacement d (Fig. 4.1).
77

We define work W done by the force F as the scalar
product of F and d.

d

Fig. 4.1
The quantity (F cose) is the component of the force in the
direction of the displacement d.
F
Thus, the work done on a body by a constant force is
defined as the product of the magnitudes of the
displacement and the component of the force in the
direction of the displacement,
V
Can you tell how much work is being done?
(i)
On the pall when a person holding the pail by the
force F is moving forward (Fig. 4.2 a).
(ii)
On the wall (Fig. 4.2 b)?
Fig. 4.2(a)
When a constant force acts through a distance d, the event
can be plótted on a simple graph (Fig. 4.3). The distance is
F
normally plotted along x-axis and the force along y-axis. In
this case as the force does not vary, the graph will be a
horizontal straight line. If the constant force F (newton) and
the displacement d (metre) are in the same direction then the
work done is Fd (joule), Clearly shaded area in Fig. 4.3 is
also Fd. Hence the area under a force- displacement curve
can be taken to represent the work done by the force. In case
the force F is not in the direction of displacement, the graph is
Fig. 4.2(b)
plotted between F cos e and d.
From the definition of work, we find that:

4.2 WORK DONE BY A VARIABLE FORCE
Fig. 4.3
In many cases the force does not remain constant during
the process of doing work. For example, as a rocket moves
78
---

away from the Earth, work is done against the force of
gravity, which varies as the inverse square of the distance
from the Earth's centre. Similarly, the force exerted by a
spring increases with the amount of stretch. How can we
calculate the work done in such a situation?
Fig. 4.4 shows the path of a particle in the x-y plane as it
moves from point a to point b. The path has been divided into
n short intervals of displacements Adj. Ad2.

and so on. The total work done in moving the object can
be calculated by adding all these terms.

We can examine this graphically by plotting E cost
verses d. as shown in Fig. 4.5. The displacement d has
been subdivided into n equal intervals. The value of

Now the /th shaded rectangle has an area Fi COSH Ad

all the rectangles. If we subdivide the distance into a large

number of intervals so that each Ad becomes very small,
the work done given by Eq. 4.2 becomes more accurate. If
we let each Ad to approach zero then we obtain an exact
result for the work done, such as

In this limit Ad approaches zero, the total area of the rectangles
(Fig. 4.5) approaches the area between the F cose curve and

Thus, the work done by a variable force in moving a particle

Example 4.1: A force Facting on an object varies with
distance x as shown in Fig. 4.7. Calculate the work done
by the force as the object moves from x = 0 to x = 6 m.
Solution: The work done by the force is equal to the

The space around the Earth in which its gravitational force
acts on a body is called the gravitational field. When an

gravitational force, the work is positive. If the displacement
is against the gravitational force, the work is negative.
Fig. 4.8
Let us consider an object of mass m being displaced with
constant velocity from point A to B along various paths in
the presence of a gravitational force (Fig. 4.8). In this case
the gravitational force is equal to the weight mg of the
object.
80
---

The work done by the gravitational force along the path
ADB can be split into two parts. The work done along AD is
zero, because the weight mg is perpendicular to this path,
the work done along DB is (-mgh) because the direction of
mg is opposite to that of the displacement i.e. e = 180°.
Hence, the work done in displacing a body from A to B
through path 1 is
WADB=0+(-mgh)=-mgh
If we consider the path ACB, the work done along AC is
also (-mgh). Since the work done along CB is zero,
therefore,
WAce=-mgh+0=-mgh -
Let us now consider path 3. i.e. a curved one. Imagine the

displacements. Work is done only
during the y displacements.
The net amount of work done along AB path is still (-mgh).
We conclude from the above discussion that
Work done in the Earth's gravitational
field is independent of the path followed.
Can you prove that the work done along a closed path
such as ACBA or ADBA (Fig. 4.8), in a gravitational field is
zero?
The field in which the work done be independent
of the path followed or work done in a closed
path be zero, is called a conservative field.
81
---

The frictional force is a non-conservative force, because if
an object is moved over a rough surface between two
points along different paths, the work done against the
frictional force certainly depends on the path followed.
4.4 POWER
In the definition of work, it is not clear, whether the same
amount of work is done in one second or in one hour. The
rate, at which work is done, is often of interest in practical
applications.
Power is the measure of the rate at which work is being
done.
If work AW is done in a time interval A t. then the average
power Pav during the interval At is defined as

Power and Velocity
It is, sometimes, convenient to express power in terms of a
constant force F acting on an object moving at constant
velocity v. For example, when the propeller of a motor boat
causes the water to exert a constant force F on the boat, it
moves with a constant velocity v. The power delivered by
the motor at any instant is, then, given by

Work-Energy Principle
Whenever work is done on a body, it increases its energy.
For example a body of mass m is moving with velocity Vj. A
force F acting through a distance d increases the velocity
to Vs. then from equation of motion

d=1(vi-vi)

where the left hand side of the above equation gives the
work done on the body and right hand side gives the
increase or change in kinetic energy of the body. Thus
Work done on the body equals the
change in its kinetic energy.
This is known as work-energy principle. If a body is raised
N
up from the Earth's surface, the work done changes the
gravitational potential energy. Similarly, if a spring is
compressed, the work done on it equals the increase in its
elastic potential energy.

Absolute Potential Energy

The absolute gravitational potential energy of an object at
1
a certain position is the work done by the gravitational
force in displacing the object from that position to infinity
where the force of gravity becomes zero. The relation for
the calculation of the work done by the gravitational force
or potential energy = mgh, is true only near the surface of
the Earth where the gravitational force is nearly constant.
But if the body is displaced through a large distance in
space from, let, point 1 to N (Fig. 4.10) in the gravitational
field, then the gravitational force will not remain constant,
since it varies inversely to the square of the distance.
earth
In order to overcome this difficulty, we divide the distance
between points 1 and N into small steps each of length Ar
so that the value of the force remains constant for each

small step. Hence, the total work done can be calculated
by adding the work done during all these steps. If fi and (2
are the distances of points 1 and 2 respectively, from the
centre o of the Earth (Fig. 4.10.), the work done during
the first step i.e., displacing a body from point 1 to point 2

Hence,
Therefore, the general expression for the gravitational
potential energy of a body situated at distance r from the
centre of Earth is
U = -GMm
This is also known as the absolute value of gravitational
potential energy of a body at a distance r from the centre
of the Earth.
87
---

Note that when r increases, U becomes less negative i.e., U
increases. It means when we raise a body above the surface
of the Earth its P.E. increases. The choibe of zero point is
arbitrary and only the difference of P.E. From one point to
another is significant, wether we consider the surfaoe of
the Earth or the point at infinity as zero P.E. reference, the
change in P.E. as we move a body above the surface of the
Earth, will always be positive.
Now the absolute potential energy on the surface of the
Earth is found by putting r = R (Radius of the Earth)

increased initial velocity, the object rises to the greater
height before coming back. If we go on increasing the initial
velocity of the object, a stage comes when it will not return
to the ground. It will escape out of the influence of gravity.
The initial velocity of an object with which it goes out of the
Earth's gravitational field, is known as escape velocity.
The escape. velocity corresponds to the initial kinetic
energy gained by the body, which carries it to an infinite
distance from the surface of Earth.
We know that the work done in lifting a body from Earth's
surface to an infinite distance is equal to the increase in
its potential energy

Hence,

Thus,
Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E. + Work done against friction.

of the same basic quantity, i.e. mechanical energy. Total

This is one of the basic laws of physics. We daily observe
many energy transformations from one form to another.
Some forms, such as electrical and chemical energy, are
more easily transferred than others, such as heat. Ultimately
all energy transfers result in heating of the environment and
energy is wasted. For example, the P.E. of the falling object
changes to K.E., but on striking the ground, the K.E. changes
into heat and sound. If it seems in an energy transfer that

collectors are used for heating water. A typical collector is
shown in Fig. 4.15 (a) It has a blackened surface which
Fig. 4.15(a)
absorbs energy directly from solar radiation. Cold water
passes over the surface and is heated upto about 70°C.
Much higher temperature can be achieved by
concentrating solar radiation on to a small surface area by
using huge reflectors (mirrors) or lenses to produced
steam for running a turbine.
The other method is the direct conversion of sunlight into
electricity through the use of semi conductor devices called
solar cells also known as photo voltaio cells. Solar cells are
thin wafers made from silicon. Electrons in the silicon gain
energy from sunlight to create a voltage. The voltage
produced by a single voltale cell is very low. In order to get
sufficient high voltage for practical use, a large number of
such cells are connected in series forming a solar cell panel.
For cloudy days or nights, electric energy can be stored
during the Sun light in Nickel cadmium batteries by
connecting them to solar panels. These batteries can then
provide power to electrical appliances at nights or on
cloudy days.
Solar cells, although, are expensive but last a long time and
have low running cost. Solar cells are used to power
satellites having large solar panels which are kept facing the
Sun (Fig. 4.15 b). Other examples of the use of solar cells
Fig. 4.15(b)
are remote ground based weather stations and rain forest
communication systems. Solar calculators and watches are
also in use now-a-days.

Geothermal Energy
This is the heat energy extracted from inside the Earth in
the form of hot water or steam. Heat within the Earth is
generated by the following processes.

1. Radioactive Decay
The energy, heating the rocks, is constantly being released
by the decay of radioactive elements.
2. Residual Heat of the Earth
At some places hot igneous rocks, usually within 10 km of
the Earth's surface, are in a molten and partly molten state.
They conduct heat energy from the Earth's interior which is
Cold
still very hot. The temperature of these rocks is about
Hot
200°C or more.
3. Compression of Material
lot Reek
The compression of material deep inside the Earth also
causes generation of heat energy-
In some place water beneath the ground is in contact with
hot rocks and is raised to high temperature and pressure. It
comes to the surface as hot springs, geysers, or steam
vents. The steam can be directed to turn turbines of
Magana
electric generators.
Fig. 4.17
At places water is not present and hot rocks are not very
deep, the water is pumped down through them to get
steam (Fig. 4.17). The steam then can be used to drive
turbines or for direct heating.
An interesting phenomenon of geothermal energy is a
geyser. It is a hot spring that discharges steam and hot water,
intermittently releasing an explosive column into the air (Fig.
4.18). Most geysers erupt at irregular intervals. They usually
occur in volcanic regions, Extraction of geothermal heat
energy often occurs closer to geyser sights. This extraction
seriously disturbs geyser system by reducing heat flow and
aquifer pressure. Aquifer is a layer of rock holding water that
allows water to percolate through it with pressure.

SUMMARY
The work done on a body by a constant force is defined as the product of the
magnitude of the displacement and the component of the force in the direction of
the displacement.
W=F.d = Fo cos e
95
---

Work done by a variable force is computed by dividing the path into very small
displacement intervals and then taking the sum of works done for all such intervals.
Ad
Graphically, the work done by a variable force in moving a particle between two
points is equal to the area under the F cost verses a curve between these two
points.
When an object is moved in the gravitational field of the Earth, the work is done by
the gravitational force. The work done in the Earth's gravitational field is independent
of the path followed, and the work done along a closed path is zero. Such a force
field is called a conservative field.
Power is defined as the rate of doing work and is expressed as
P=AW
or
P==F.v
Energy of a body is its capacity to do work. The kinetic energy is the energy possessed
by a body due to its motion.
The potential energy is possessed by a body because of its position in a force field.
The absolute P.E of a body on the surface of Earth is
U3 ==GMm =
The initial velocity of a body with which it should be projected upward so that it does not
come back, is called escape velocity,
Vonce = 2GM R = w 2gR
Some of the non conventional energy sources are
1. Energy from the tides
2 Energy from waves
3. Solar energy
Energy from biomass
5. Energy from waste products
