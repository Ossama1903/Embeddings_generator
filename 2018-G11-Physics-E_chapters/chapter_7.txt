any a times, we come across a type of motion in which 8 body moves to and fro about
a mean position. It is called oscillatory or vibratory motion. The oscillatory motion is called
periodic when it repeats itself after equal intervals of time.
Some typical vibrating bodies are shown in Fig. 7.1. It is our common observation that
a) a mass, suspended from a spring. when pulled down and then released. starts
oscillating (Fig. 7.1 a),
b) the bob of a simple pendulum when displaced from its rest position and released,
vibrates (Fig. 7.1 b).
---

c) a steel ruler clamped at one end to a bench oscillates
when the free end is displaced sideways (Fig. 7.1 c),
d) a steel ball rolling in a curved dish, oscillates about its
rest position (Fig. 7.1 d).
Thus to get oscillations, a body is pulled away from its rest
or equilibrium position and then released. The body oscilliates
si
due to a restoring force. Under the action of this restoring
force, the body accelerates and it overshoots the rest
position due to inertia. The restoring force then pulls it
back. The restoring force is always directed towards
the rest position and so the acceleration is also directed
towards the rest or mean position.
It is observed that the vibrating bodies produce waves

For example, a violin string produces sound waves in air.
There are many phenomena in nature whose explanation
requires the understanding of the concepts of vibrations

and waves. Although many large structures, such as
(Vibrating objectil
skyscrapers and bridges, appear to be rigid, they actually
vibrate. The architects and the engineers who design and
Puà 71
build them, take this fact into account.
7.1 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
Let US consider a mass m attached to one end of an elastic
spring which can move freely on a frictionless horizontal
surface as shown in Fig. 7.2 (a). When the mass is
displaced towards right through a distance x (Fig. 7.2 b),
the force F at that instant is given by Hooke's law F il kx
where k is a constant known as spring constant. Due to
m
elasticity, spring opposes the applied force which produces
[N]
the displacement This opposing force is called restoring
F.
force F. which is equal and opposite to the applied force
in
within elastic limit of the spring. Hence

directly proportional to the displacement x of the system
from its equilibrium position and is always directed towards
it. When the mass is released, it begins to oscillate about
the equilibrium position (Fig. 7.2 c). The oscillatory motion
taking place under the action of such a restoring force is

known as simple harmonic motion (SHM). The acceleration
a produced in the mass m due to restoring force can be
calculated using second law of motion

Then,

(7.2)

The acceleration at any instant of a body
executing SHM is proportional to displacement
and is always directed towards its mean position.
We will now discuss various terms which are very often
used in describing SHM
(1)
Instantaneous Displacement and Amplitude
of Vibration
Movement of Paper
It can be seen in Fig. 7.2 that when a body is vibrating. its
displacement from the mean position changes with time.
The value of its distance from the mean position at any
A
time is known as its instantaneous displacement. It is zero
at the instant when the body is at the mean position and is
maximum at the extreme positions. The maximum value of
displacement is known as amplitude,
The arrangement shown in Fig. 7.3 can be used to record
the variations in displacement with time for D mass-spring
system. The strip of paper is moving at a constant speed
from right to left, thus providing a time scale on the strip.
A pen attached with the vibrating mass records its
displacement against time as shown in Fig. 7.3. It can
be seen that the curve showing the variation of
displacement with time is a sine curve. It is usually
known as wave-form of SHM The points B and D
correspond to the extreme positions of the vibrating mass
and points A_C and E show its mean position. Thus the line
ACE represents the level of mean position of the mass on
the strip. The ampitude of vibration la thus a measure of
the line Bb or Dd in Fig. 7.3.
143
---

(II)
Vibration
A vibration means one complete round trip of the body in
motion. In Fig. 7.3, it is the motion of mass from its mean
position to the upper extreme position, from upper extreme
position to lower extreme position and back to its mean
position. In Fig. 7.3, the curve ABCDE correspond to the
different positions of the pen during one complete
vibration. Alternatively the vibration can also be defined as
motion of the body from its one extreme position back to
the same extreme position. This will correspond to the
portion of curve from points B lo F or from points D to H.
(iii) Time Period
It Is the time T required to complete one vibration.
(iv)
Frequency
Frequency f is the number of vibrations executed by a body
in one second and is expressed as vibrations per second
or cycles per second or hertz (Hz).
The definitions of T and / show that the two quantities are
related by the equation
1
(7.3)
(v)
Angular Frequency
If T is the time period of a body executing SHM, its angular
frequency will be
==2==2nf
(7.4)
Angular frequency a is basically a characteristic of circular
motion. Here it has been introduced in SHM because it
provides an easy method by which the value of
instantaneous displacement and Instantaneoua velocity of
a body executing SHM can be computed.
7.2 SHM AND UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION
Let a mass m. attached with the end of a vertically
suspended spring, vibrate simple harmonically with period
T. frequency f and amplitude Xo The motion of the mass is
displayed by the pointer P on the line BC with A as mean
position and B, C as extreme positions (Fig. 7.4a).
Assuming A BB the position of the pointer at
I = 0. it will move so that it is at B.A.C and back to A at
144
---

instants 7/4, 772. 3774 and T respectively. This will
complete one cycle of vibration with ampiltude of vibration
being No = AB = AC.
The concept of circular motion is introduced by considering a
point P moving on a circle of radius X with a uniform angular
frequency a = 2e/T. where T is the time period of the
vibration of the pointer, It may be noted that the radius of the
circle in equal to the amplitude of the pointer's motion.
Consider the motion of the point N. the projection of P on the
diameter DE drawn parallel to the line of vibration of the
pointer in Fig. 7.4 (b) Note that the level of points D and E

(c)
is the same as the points B and C. As P describes
uniform circular motion with a constant angular speed 04 N
osciliates to and fro on the diameter DE with time period T.
Assuming O, to be the position of P at / = 0 the position of
the point N at the instants 0, 774, 772, 3774 and T will be at
the points O.D.O.E and o respectively. A comparison of the
motion of N with that of the pointer P. shows that it is a
replica of the pointer's motion. Thus the expressions of
displacement, velocity and acceleration for the motion of N
also hold good for the pointer P. executing SHM.
(i)
Displacement
Referring to Fig. 7,4 (b), if we count the time f = D from the
instant when P is passing through O, the angle which the
radius OP sweeps out in time I is 20.0P = e = m The
displacement x of N at the instant / will be
x ON = OP sin ZO.OP
145
---

or
x=x sine
or
of
(7.5)
This will be also the displacement of the pointer P. at the
instant f.
The value of x as a functions of 0 is shown in Fig. 7.4 (c).
This is the wave-form of SHM. In Fig. 7.3, the same wave-
form was traced experimentally but here, we have traced it
theoretically by linking SHM with circular motion through
the concept of angular frequency The angle 0 gives the
states of the system in its vibrational cycle. For example, at
the start of the cycle 0 = D. Half way through the cycle, is
180° ( II radians). When e = 270° (or 3r/2 radians). the
cycle is three-fourth completed. We call a as the phase of
the vibration. Thus when quarter of the cycle is completed,
phase of vibration is 90° (or (1) radian). Thus phase is also

(7.6)
As the motion of N on the diameter DE is due to motion of P
on the circle, the velocity of N is actually the component of
the velocity Ve in a direction paraliel to the diameter DE. As

Thus the magnitude of the velocity of N or its speed is
(7.7)
The direction of the velocity of N depends upon the value
of the phase angle B. When e is between 0° to 90° the
direction is from o to D. for 0 between 90° to 270°, its
direction is from D to E. When A is between 270° to 360°, the
direction of motion is from E to D.

As the motion of N on the diameter DE is just the replica of
the motion of the pointer executing SHM (Fig. 7.4). so
velocity of the point P or the velocity of any body
executing SHM is given by equations 7.7 and 7.8 in terms
of the angular frequency (0 Eq. 7.8 shows that at the
mean position. where x = 0, the velocity is maximum and
at the extreme positions where = X the velocity is zero,
(iii) Acceleration in Terms of
11
When the point P is moving on the circle, it has an
acceleration a, = always directed towards the centre o
of the circle.
At instant Lits direction will be along PO The accoleration of
the point Nwill be component of the acceleration, ag along the
diameter DE on which N moves due to motion of P. As
shown in Fig. 7.5 (b). the value of this component is

Comparison of Fig. 7.5 (b) and 7.4 (b) shows that the
direction of acceleration a and displacement x are
E
opposite. Considering the direction of x as reference. the
acceleration a will be represented by
Flu 7.5(b)
a = x
(7.9)
Eq. 7.9 shows that the acceleration is proportional to the
displacement and is directed towards the mean position
which is the characteristic of SHM. Thus the point N is
executing SHM with the same amplitude, period and
instantaneous displacement as the pointer P. This
confirms our assertion that the motion of N is just a replica
of the pointer's motion,
7.3 PHASE
Equations 7.5 and 7.7 indicate that displacement and
velocity of the point executing SHM are determined by the
angle e = mL Note that this angle is obtained when SHM is
related with circular motion. If is the angle which the rotating
147
---

radius OP makes with the reference direction 00, at any
instant I (Fig. 7.4 b),
The angle e=wi which specifies the
displacement as well as the direction of motion
of the point executing SHM is known as phase,
a/2
The phase determines the state of motion of the vibrating
point. If a body starts its motion from mean position, its
#10
phase at this point would be D. Similarly at the extreme
positions. its phase would be a/2
3n/2
in Fig. 7.4 (b), we have assumed that to start with at 1=0,
D
the position of the rotating radius OP is along OO, so that

the point N is at its mean position and the displacement at

reference 00, as shown in Fig. 7.6 (a). In time if, the radius

angle (ood + P) with OO, at the instant f and the
displacement ON =x at instant 1 would be given by

(7.10)
Now the phase angle is of + i.e.,
when t = 0. 0=c. So @ is the initial phase. If we take initial
phase as n/2 or 90°, the displacement as given by Eq 710
is
sin(ef(+90")

As A and m are constant, we see that the acceleration is

7.6 ENERGY CONSERVATION IN SHM
Let us consider the case of a vibrating mass-spring
system. When the mass m is pulled slowly, the spring is
stretched by an amount Kg against the elastic restoring
force F. It is assumed that stretching is done slowly so that
acceleration is zero. According to Hooke's law
E=kxa
When
displacement =0
force=0
When
displacement = Xo
force = kx,
Average force
Work done in displacing the mass m through Xa is
W=Fd=
This work appears as elastic potential energy of the spring.
Hence
(7.21)
The Eq. 7.21 gives the maximum P.E. at the extreme
position. Thus
At any instant f, if the displacement is X, then P.E. at that
instant is given by

The velocity at that instant is given by Eq. 7.15 which is

Hence the K.E. at that instant is

(7,25)
Thus the total energy of the vibrating mass and spring is
constant. When the K.E. of the mass is maximum, the P.E.
of the spring is zero. Conversely, when the P.E. of the
spring is maximum, the K.E. of the mass is zero. The
interchange occurs continuously from one form to the other
as the spring is compressed and released alternately
The variation of P.E. and K.E. with displacement is
essential for maintaining oscillations. This periodic
exchange of energy is a basic property of all deciliatory
systems. In the case of simple pendulum gravitational P.E.
of the mass, when displaced, is converted into K.E. at the
153
---

equilibrium position. The K.E. is converted into P.E. as the
mass rises to the tap of the awing. Because of the frictional
forces, energy is dissipated and consequently, the systems
do not oscillate indefinitely.
Example 7.3: A spring, whose spnng constant is
80.0Nm vertically supports a mass of 1.0 kg in the rest
position. Find the distance by which the mass must be

7.7 FREE AND FORCED OSCILLATIONS
A body said to be executing free vibrations when If cocilates
without the interference of an external force. The frequency
of these free vibrations is known as its natural frequency.
For example, a simple pendulum when slightly displaced
from its mean position vibrates freely with its natural frequency
that depends only upon the length of the pendulum.
On the other hand, if a freely oscillating system is subjected
to an external periodic force, then forced vibrations will
take place Such as when the mass of a vibrating
pendulum is struck repeatedly, then forced vibrations are
produced
154
---

A physical system under going forced vibrations
is known as driven harmonic oscillator.
The vibrations of a vehicle body caused by the running of
engine is an example of forced vibrations Another example
of forced vibration is loud music produced by sounding
wooden boards of string instruments.
7.8 RESONANCE

Associated with the motion of a driven harmonic oscillator,
there is a very striking phenomenon, known as resonance.

period comparable to the natural period of the caciliator.

In a resonance situation, the driving force may be feeble,
the amplitude of the motion may become extra ordinarily
large. In the case of oscillating simple pendulum, if we
blow to push the pendulum whenever it comes in front of
our mouth, it is found that the amplitudo steadily increases.

Advantages And Disadvantages of Resonance
We come across many examples of resonance in every
day life. A swing is a good example of mechanical
interesting information
resonance It is like a pendulum with a single natural frequency
depending on its length. If a series of regular pushes are
given to the swing, its motion can be built up enormously If
pushes are given irregularly, the swing will hardly vibrate

SUMMARY
Osciliatory motion is to and fro motion about a mean position.
Periodic motion is the one that repeats itself after equal intervals of time.
Restoring force opposes the change in shape or length of a body and is equal and
opposite to applied force.
A vibratory motion in which acceleration IB directly proportional to displacement from
mean position and is always directed towards the mean position is known as simple
harmonic motion.
The projection of a particle moving in a circle executes SHM Its time period Tis
2s
111
Phase of vibration is the quantity which indicates the state of motion of a vibrating
particle generally referred by the phase angle.
The vibratory motion of a mass attached to an elastic spring is SHM and its time
period is T=2n/m
The vibratory motion of the bob of simple pendulum is also SHM and its time period
is given by

In an oscillating system P.E. and K.E. interchange and total energy is conserved.
A body is said to be executing free escillation it it vibrates with its own natural
frequency without the interference of an external force.
When a freely oscillating system is subjected to an external periodic force, than
forced vibrations take place
Resonance is the specific response of a system to a periodic force acting with the
natural vibrating period of the system.
Damping is the process whereby energy is dissipated from the oscillating system.
