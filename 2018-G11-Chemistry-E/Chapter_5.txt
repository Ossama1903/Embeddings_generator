5.1 SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLES OF ATOM
 We  are familiar with the nature of matter, which is made up of  extremely small particles called 
atoms. According to Dalton’s theory, atoms were considered to be ultimate p articles which could 
not be divided any further. Our ideas about structure of atom have un dergone radical changes 
over the years. A number of subatomic particles have been discovered. T he experiments which led 
to the discovery of electron, proton and neutron are described below.

5.1.1Discovery of Electron (Cathode Rays)               
 A gas discharge tube is itted with two metallic electrodes acting a s cathode and anode. The 
tube is illed with a gas, air or vapours of a substance at an y desired pressure. The electrodes are 
connected to a source of high voltage. The exact voltage required depend s upon the length of the 
tube and the pressure inside the tube. The tube is attached to a vac uum pump by means of a small 
side tube so that the conduction of electricity may be studied at any value of low pressure Fig (5.1).
It is observed that current does not low through the gas at ordinary p ressure even at high voltage 
of 5000 volts. When the pressure inside the tube is reduced and a  high voltage of 5000-10000  volts 
is applied, then an electric discharge takes place through the ga s producing a uniform glow inside 
the tube. When the pressure is reduced further to about 0.01 torr, th e original glow disappeares. 
Some rays are produced which create luorescence on the glass wall opposite to the cathode. 
These rays are called cathode rays. The  colour of the glow or the l uorescence produced on the 
walls of the glass tube, depends upon the composition of glass.

5.1.2 Properties of Cathode Rays
To  study the properties of cathoe rays systematic investigations were made by many scientists. 
They established the following properties of cathode rays.       
1. Cathode rays are negativelycharged. In 1895, J Perrin showe d that when the cathode rays passed 
between the poles of the magnet, the path of the negatively charged partic les was curved downward 
to point 2 by the magnetic ield. Fig (5.2)
 In 1897, J. Thomson established their electric charge by the ap plication of electric ield, the cathode 
ray particles were delected upwards (towards the positive plate) to poin t 3. Fig. (5.2) 
Thomson found that by carefully controlling the charge on the pl ates when the plates and the 
magnet were both around the tube, he could make the cathode rays stri ke the tube at point 1 
again Fig.(5.2). In other words, he was able to cancel the efect of the magnetic ield by applying an 
electric ield that tended to bend the path of the cathode rays in the opposi te direction.

2. They produce a greenish luorescence on striking the walls of th e glass tube. These rays also 
produce luorescence in rare earths and minerals. When placed in  the path of these rays, alumina 
glows red and tin stone yellow.Fig (5.2) Delection of cathode rays

3.  Cathode rays cast a shadow when an opaque object is placed in their path. This  proves that 
they travel q straight line perpendicular to the surface of cathode F ig (5.3).
4.  These rays can drive a small paddle wheel placed in th eir path. This  shows that these rays 
possess momentum. From this observation, it is inferred that cathode r ays are not rays but material 
particles having a deinite mass and velocity Fig (5.4).

5.  Cathode rays can produce X-rays when they strike an anod e particularly with large atomic 
mass Fig (5.18).
6.  Cathode  rays can produce heat when they fall on matter e.g . when cathode rays from a 
concave cathode are focussed on a platinum foil, it begins to glow.
7.  Cathode rays can ionize gases.
8.  They can cause a chemical change, because they have a redu cing efect.
9.  Cathode rays can pass through a thin metal foil like alu minum or gold foil.
10.  The  e/m value of cathode rays shows that they are simply electrons. J.J. Thomson concluded 
from his experiments that cathode rays consist of streams of negati vely charged particles. Stoney 
named these particles as electrons. Thomson also determined the charg e to mass ratio (e/m) of 
electrons. He found that the e/m value remained the same no matter whi ch gas was used in the 
discharge tube. He concluded that all atoms contained electrons.
5.1.3 Discovery of Proton (Positive Rays)
 In 1886, German physicist, E. Goldstein took a discharge tube provided with a cathode having 
extremely ine holes in it. When a large potential diference is appli ed between electrodes, it is 
observed that while cathode rays are travelling away from cathode, ther e are other rays produced 
at the same time. These rays after passing through the perforated cathode produce a glow on 
the wall opposite to the anode. Since these rays pass through the ca nals or the holes of cathode, 
they are called canal rays. These rays are named as positive ra ys owing to the fact that they carry 
positive  charge Fig (5.5).
Fig (5.5) Production of positive rays85.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
Reason for the Production of Positive Rays
 These positive rays are produced, when high speed 
cathode rays (electrons) strike the molecules of a gas 
enclosed in the discharge tube. They knock out electrons 
from the gas molecules and positive ions are produced, 
which start moving towards the cathode Fig (5.5).

5.1.4 Properties of Positive Rays
1.  They are delected by an electric as well as a 
magnetic ield showing, that these are positively charged.
2.  These rays travel in a straight line in a direction 
opposite to the cathode rays.
3.  They produce lashes on ZnS plate.
4.  The  e/m value for the positive rays is always smaller than that of electrons and depends 
upon the nature of the gas used in the discharge tube. Heavier the g as, smaller the e/m value. 
When hydrogen gas is used in the discharge tube, the e/m value is  found to be the maximum in 
comparison to any other gas because the value of’m’ is the lowest for th e positive particle obtained 
from the hydrogen gas. Hence the positive particle obtained from hydr ogen gas is the lightest 
among all the positive particles. This particle is called proton,  a name suggested by Rutherford.
The mass of a proton is 1836 times more than that of an electron.
5.1.5 Discovery of Neutron
 Proton and electron were discovered in 1886 and their properties were completely determined 
till 1895. It is very strange to know that upto 1932 it was thought that an atom was composed of 
only electrons and protons. Rutherford predicted in 1920 that some kind of neutral particle having 
mass equal to that of proton must be present in an atom, because he noti ced that atomic masses 
of atoms could not be explained,if it were supposed that atoms had on ly electrons and protons.
Chadwick discovered neutron in 1932 and was awarded Nobel pri ze in Physics in 1935.

Experiment
 A stream of a-particles produced from a polonium source was d irected at beryllium (9

target. It was noticed that some penetrating radiation were produced. Th ese radiations were called 
neutrons because the charge detector showed them to be neutral Fig (5.6 ). The nuclear reaction is 
as follows.

2.  Neutrons cannot ionize gases.
3.  Neutrons are highly penetrating particles.
4.  They can expel high speed protons from parain, water, paper  and cellulose.
5.  When neutrons travel with an energy 1.2 Mev (Mega electron volt 106), they are called fast  
           neutrons but with  energy below 1ev are called slow neu trons. Slow neutrons are usually more  
         efective than fast ones for the ission purposes.
6.  When neutrons are used as projectiles, they can carry out the n uclear reactions. A fast  
                    neutron ejects an a-particle from the nucl eus of nitrogen atom and boron is produced, alongwith  
         and a-particles.

5.1.7 Measurement of e
m Value of Electron
 In 1897, J.J Thomson devised an instrument to measure the e/m valu e of electron. The 
apparatus consists of a discharge tube shown in Fig. (5.7).  
 The cathode rays are allowed to pass through electric and magneti c ields. When both the 
ields are of then a beam of cathode rays, consisted of electrons, prod uces bright luminous spot 
at P1 on the luorescent screen. 
The  north and south poles of magnetic ield are perpendicular to the plane of paper in the diagram. 
The electrical ield is in the plane of paper. When only magnetic ield is applied, the cathode rays are 
delected in a circular path and fall at the point P3. When only electric ield is applied, the cathode 
rays produce a spot at P2. Both electric and magnetic ields are then applied simultaneously  and 
their strengths adjusted in such a way that cathode rays again hit the point P1.  
In this way by comparing the strengths of the two ields one can deter mine the e/m value of 
eIlectrons. It comes out to be 1.7588 x 1011 coulombs kg-1. This means that 1 kg of electrons have 
1.7588 x 1011 coulombs of charge.

5.1.8 Measurement of Charge on Electron - Millikan's  Oil Drop Method
 In 1909, Millikan determined the charge 
on electron by a simple arrangement. The 
apparatus consists of a metallic chamber.It 
has two parts. The chamber is illed with air, 
the pressure of which can be adjusted by a 
vacuum pump. 
There are two electrodes A and A’ These 
electrodes are used- to generate an electrical 
ield in the space between the electrodes. 
The upper electrode has a hole in it as shown 
in Fig (5.8).
 A ine spray of oil droplets is created by 
an atomizer. A few droplets passes through 
the hole in the top plate and into the region 
between the charged plates, where one of them is observed though a mic roscope. This droplet, 
when illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of view, appears  in the microscope as bright 
speck against a dark background. The  droplet falls under the force of gravity without applying the 
electric ield. The velocity of the droplet is determined. The velocity of the droplet (V1) depends 
upon its weight, mg.
    1v mga           ..............            (1)
where ’m’ is the mass of the droplet and  ‘g’ is the acceleration  due to gravity. After that the air 
between the electrodes is ionized by X-rays. The  droplet under obser vation  takes up an electron 
and gets charged. Now, connect A and A’ to a battery which genera tes an electric ield having a 
strength, E. The droplet moves upwards against the action of gravi ty with a velocity (v2).

applied electrical ield of strength E.

Fig (5.8) Millikan's oil drop method for
determination of charge of electron135.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 The  values of v1 and v2 are recorded with the help of microscope. The factors like g and E  are 
also known. Mass of the droplet can be determined by varying the elec tric ield in such a way that 
the droplet is suspended in the chamber. Hence ‘e’ can be calcu lated.
  By changing the strength of electrical ield, Millikan found that the charge on each droplet 
was diferent. The  smallest charge which he found was 1.59 x  10-19 coulombs, which is very close 
to the recent value of 1.6022 x 10-19 coulombs. This smallest charge on any droplet is the charge of  
one electron. The other drops having more than one electron on them, have d ouble or triple the 
amount of this charge. The charge present on an electron is the sma llest charge of electricity that 
has been measured so far.
Mass of Electron
 The value of charge on electron is 1.602 x 10-19 coulombs, while e/m of electron is 1.7588 x 
1011 coulombs kg-1. So,

5.2 Rutherford's Model of Atom (Discovery of Nucleus)
In 1911, Lord Rutherford performed 
a classic experiment. He studied 
the scattering of high speed 
a-particles. which were emitted 
from a radioactive metal (radium or 
polonium)
 A beam of a-partides was 
directed onto a gold foil of 0.00004 
cm thickness as target through a 
pin-hole in lead plate, Fig (5.9). 
 A photographic plate or a 
screen coated with zinc sulphide 
was used as a detector. Whenever, 
an a-partide struck  the screen, lash 
of light was produced at that point. It was observed that most of the pa rticles went through the 
foil undelected. Some were delected at fairly large angles and a few  were delected backward. 
Rutherford proposed that the rebounding particles must have collided w ith the central heavy 
portion of the atom which he called as nucleus.      
 On the basis of these experimental observations, Rutherford proposed the planetary model 
(similar to the solar system) for an atom in which a tiny nucl eus is surrounded by an appropriate  
number of electrons. Atom as a whole being neutral, therefore, the nu cleus must be having the 
same number of protons as there are number of electrons surroundin g it.
 In Rutherford’s model for the structure of an atom, the outer electrons c ould  not be stationary. 
If they were, they would gradually be attracted by the nucleus ti ll they ultimately fall into it. Therefore, 
to have a stable atomic structure, the electrons were supposed to be moving around the nucleus 
in closed orbits. The nuclear atom of Rutherford was a big step ahead towards understanding the 
atomic structure, but the behaviour of electrons remained unexplained in the atom.
 Rutherford’s planet-like picture was Electron defective and unsa tisfactory because the moving 
electron must be accelerated towards the nucleus Fig (5.10). 
 Fig (5.9) Rutherford's experiment for scattering 0f a-partices155.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
Therefore, the radius of the orbiting electron should become smaller and smaller and the electron 
should fall into the nucleus. Thus, an atomic structure as pr oposed by Rutherford would collapse.
5.3 PLANCK'S QUANTUM THEORY
 Max  Planck proposed the quantum theory in 1900 to explain th e emission and absorption of 
radiation. According to his revolutionary’ theory, energy travels in a discontinuous manner and it is 
composed of large number of tiny discrete units called quanta. T he main points of his theory are:
(i)  Energy is not emitted or absorbed continuously. Rather, it is  emitted or absorbed in a 
discontinuous manner and in the form of wave packets. Each wa ve packet or quantum is associated 
with a deinite amount of energy. In case of light, the quantum of en ergy is often called photon.
(ii)  The  amount of energy associated with a quantum of rad iation is proportional to the frequency 
(v) of the radiation. Frequency is the number of waves passing through a point per sec ond.
    E  v∝
    E = hv 																.............................						 								(4)
Fig (5.10) Rotation of electron around the
nucleus and expected spiral path165.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 Where ’h’ is a constant known as Planck’s constant and its va lue is 6.626x10-34 Js. It is, in fact, 
the ratio of energy and the frequency of a photon.
(iii)  A body can emit or absorb energy only in terms of quanta .
     E = hv
 The frequency ‘v ‘ is related to the wavelength of the photon as
     l v=c/
 Greater the wavelength, smaller the frequency of photon
  So,    l E=hc/             ............................(5)
 Wavelength is the distance between the two adjacent crests or troughs an d expressed in o
A, 
nm or pm. (1o
A =10 -10’m’, lnm = 10-9m, lpm=10-12m) 
 Greater  the wavelength associated with the photon, smaller is its energy .  Wave number (v) 
is the number of waves per unit length, and is reciprocal to wavel ength.
                                                                         l = 1/v 
 Putting the value of  l = 1/v  in equation (5)
     E = h c v                 ............................(6)
 So, the energy of a photon is related to frequency, wavelength and w ave number.
Greater  the wave number of photons, greater is the energy associated wi th them. The relationships 
of energy, frequency, wavelength, wave number about the photon of ligh t are accepted by scientists 
and used by Bohr in his atomic model.
5.4 BOHR’S MODEL OF ATOM
 Bohr made an extensive use of the quantum theory of Planck and pr oposed that the electron, 
in the hydrogen atom, can only exist in certain permitted quantized energy levels. The main 
postulates of Bohr’s theory are:
(i)  Electron revolves in one  of the circular orbits outside the  nucl eus. Each orbit has a ixed 
energy and a quantum number is assigned to it.
(ii)  Electron present in a particular orbit neither emits nor a bsorbs energy  while moving in the 
same ixed orbits. The energy is emitted or absorbed only when an elec tron jumps from one orbit 
to another.175.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
(iii)  When an electron jumps, the energy change AE is given by  the Planck’s equation
  E฀=E2-E1 = hv                          ..................    (7)
 Where E฀   is the energy diference of any two orbits with energies E1 and E2 Energy is absorbed 
by the electron when it jumps from an inner orbit to an outer orbit a nd is emitted when the electron 
jumps from outer to inner orbit. Electron can revolve only in those orbits  having a ixed angular 
momentum (mvr). The angular momentum of an orbit depends upon its  quantum number and it 
is an integral multiple of the factor h/2 π i.e.
                 pnhmvr=2           ............................          (8 )
Where n = 1,2,3,.............
 The permitted values of angular momenta are, therefore, ph
2 , p2h
2  , p3h
2   ..............
The electron is bound to remain in one of these orbits and not in between  them. So, angular 
momentum is quantized.
Derivation of Radius and Energy of Revolving Electro n in nth Orbit.
 By applying these ideas, Bohr derived the expression for the rad ius of the nth orbit in hydrogen 
atom.
 For a general atom, consider an electron of charge ‘e’ revolving ar ound the nucleus having 
charge Ze+. Z being the proton number 
and e+ is the charge on the proton Fig 
(5.11).
 Let m be the mass of electron, r 
the radius of the orbit and v the velocity 
of the revolving electron. According to 
Coulombs law, the electrostatic force of 
attraction between the electron and the 
nucleus will be given by the f ollowing 
formula .

According to equation (10), the radius of a moving electron is i nversely proportional to the square 
of its velocity. It conveys the idea, that electron should move faster near er to the nucleus in an orbit 
of smaller radius. It also tells, that if hydrogen atom has man y possible orbits, then the promotion 
of electron to higher orbits makes it move with less velocity.
 The determination of velocity of electron is possible while moving in th e orbit. In order 
to eliminate the factor of velocity from equation (10), we use Bohr’s postulate (iv). The angular 
momentum of the electron is given by.

Energy of Revolving Electron
 The total energy of an electron in an orbit is composed of two parts,  the kinetic energy which 
is equal to 2 1mv2 and the potential energy. The value of potential energy can be calcu lated as follows.

 In order to calculate the potential energy of the electron at a distanc e r from the nucleus, we

the nucleus. This can be obtained by integrating the above expression  between the limits of ininity

ininity to a point at a distance ’r’ from the nucleus. At ininity , the electron is not being attracted by 
any thing and the potential energy of the system is zero. Whereas a t a point nearer the nucleus, it 
will be attracted by the nucleus and the potential energy becomes l ess than zero. The quantity less 
than zero is negative. For this reason, the potential energy given by equ ation (15) is negative.215.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
The  total energy (E) of the electron, is the sum of kinetic and potenti al charges.
 So,   kinetic potential EE E= +

5.5 SPECTRUM
 When  a radiation of light is passed through a prism, the ra diation undergoes refraction or 
bending. The extent of bending 
depends upon the wavelength of 
the photons. A radiation of longer 
wavelength is bent to a smaller 
degree than the radiation of a 
shorter wavelength. Ordinary, 
white light consists of radiation 
of all wavelengths, and so after 
passing through the prism, white 
light is splitted up into radiations of 
diferent wavelengths.
 The colours of visible 
spectrum are violet, indigo, blue, 
green, orange, yellow and red and 
their wavelengths range from 400 
nm to 750 nm. In addition to the 
visible region of the spectrum, there 
are seven other regions. Ultraviolet, 
X-rays, y-rays and cosmic rays are 
towards the lower wavelength end 
of the spectrum and they possess 
the photons with greater energies. On the other side of the visible regi on, there lies infrared, 
microwave and radio frequency regions. Fig. (5.13) shows the c ontinuity of wavelengths for all 
types of regions of spectrum. Hence, a visual display or dispe rsion of the components of white 
light, when it is passed through a prism is called a spectr um. 
Fig (5.13) The visible and other
regions of spectrum255.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
Spectrum is of two types.
 (i)  Continuous spectrum (ii)  Line spectrum
 5.5.1 Continuous Spectrum
 In this type of spectrum, the boundry line between the colours cann ot be marked. The colours 
difuse into each other. One colour merges into another without any d ark space. The best example 
of continuous spectrum is rainbow. It is obtained from the light em itted by the sun or incandescent 
(electric light) solids. It is the characteristic of matter in bul k. 
5.5.2 Atomic or Line Spectrum
When an element or its compound is volatilized on a lame and the lig ht emitted is seen through 
a spectrometer, We see distinct lines separated by dark spaces. T his type of spectrum is called 
line spectrum or atomic spectrum. This is characteristic of an atom. The number of lines and 
the distance between them depend upon the element volatilized. For exampl e, line spectrum of 
sodium contains two yellow coloured lines separated by a deinite di stance. Similarly, the spectrum 
of hydrogen consists of a number of lines of diferent colours havin g diferent distances from 
each other. It has also been observed that distances between the lines for  the hydrogen spectrum 
decrease with the decrease in wavelength and the spectrum becomes conti nuous after a certain 
value of wavelength Fig (5.14).
Fig (5.14) Atomic spectrum of hydrogen265.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 Atomic spectrum can also be observed when elements in gaseous state ar e heated at high 
temperature or subjected to an electric discharge.
 There are two ways in which an atomic spectrum can be viewed.
(i)  Atomic emission spectrum
(ii)  Atomic absorption spectrum
5.5.3 Atomic Emission Spectrum
When solids are volatilized or elements in their gaseous states are h eated to high temperature or 
subjected to an electrical discharge, radiation of certain wavelength s are emitted. The spectrum 
of this radiation contained bright lines against a dark backg round. This is called atomic emission 
spectrum. Fig (5.15)
5.5.4 Atomic Absorption Spectrum
 When a beam of white light is passed through a gaseous sample of an element, the element 
absorbs certain wavelengths while the rest of wavelengths pass thr ough it. The spectrum of this 
radiation is called an atomic absorption spectrum. The wavelength s of the radiation that have been 
absorbed by the element appear as dark lines and the backgroun d is bright, Fig (5.16).
Fig (5.15) Atomic emission spectrum275.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
Fig (5.16) Atomic absorption spectrum
 It is  interesting to note that the positions or the wavelengths of lines  appearing in both 
emission and absorption spectra are exactly the same. In emission spectrum, these lines appear 
bright because the corresponding wavelengths are being emitted by the element, whereas they 
appear dark in absorption spectrum because the wavelengths are bein g absorbed by the element.
5.5.5 Hydrogen Spectrum
 Hydrogen-spectrum is an important example of atomic spectrum. H ydrogen is illed in a 
discharge tube at a very low pressure a bluish light is emitted f rom the discharge tube. This light 
when viewed through a spectrometer shows several isolated sharp lines. 
 These are called spectral lines. The wavelengths of these lines lie in the visible, ultraviolet and 
infrared regions. These spectral lines can be classiied into i ve groups called spectral series. These 
series are named after their discoverers as shown below.
(i)  Lyman series (U.V region)    (ii)  Balmer series (visib le region)
(iii)  Paschen series (LR region)    (iv)  Brackett series (I. R region)
(v)  Pfund series (I.R region)285.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 The irst four series were discovered before Bohr’s atomic model (1913 ). The wave numbers 
(m-1) of the series of lines in hydrogen spectrum are given in Tabl e (5.2).
 It is seen from the Table (5.2) that as we proceed from Lyman s eries to Pfund series, the wave 
numbers (m-1) of spectral lines decrease. The lines of Balmer series have been
given speciic names as H α, H β ........, etc.

5.5.6 Origin of Hydrogen Spectrum on the Basis of Bo hr’s Model
According to Bohr, electron in hydrogen atom may revolve in any orbi t depending upon its energy. 
When hydrogen gas is heated or subjected to an electric discharge, its electron moves from one 
of the lower orbit to higher orbit, absorbing particular wavelength of  energy. Subsequently, when 
it comes back, the same energy is released. This energy is obs erved as radiation of particular 
wavelengths in the form of bright lines seen in the certain region of  the emission spectrum of 
hydrogen gas.295.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
The spectral lines of Lyman series are produced when the electron ju mps from n2= 2, 3,4,5, to, n, 
= 1 (Lyman did not know this reason). Similarly, spectral lines of Balmer series discovered in 1887 
originated when an electron jumps from n2 = 3, 4, 5, 6,................. to n1= 2orbit.
 In  the same way, Paschen, Brackett and Pfund series of lines  are produced as a result of 
electronic transitions from higher orbits to 3rd, 4th and 5th orbits , respectively Fig (5.17).
 
Calculations of Wave Numbers of Photons of Various Spec tral Series by Bohr’s Theory
 The wavelength ( l ) or wave number ( v) of a spectral line depends on the quantity of energy 
emitted by the electron. Suppose, an electron jumps from n2 to n, and emits a photon of light. 
According to Bohr’s equation of energy

 The limiting line of Balmer series lies in U.V region, while oth er lines fall in visible region. 
Similarly, we can calculate the wave numbers for all the lines  of Paschen, Brackett and Pfund series. 
These three series of lines lie in the infrared region.
5.5.7 Defects of Bohr’s Atomic Model
1.  Bohr’s theory can successfully explain the origin of the sp ectrum of H-atom and ions like 
He+1, Li+2 and Be+3, etc. These are all one electron systems. But this theory is not able to explain the 
origin of the spectrum of multi-electrons or poly-electrons system li ke He, Li and Be, etc.
2.  When the spectrum of hydrogen gas is observed by means of a high resolving power 
spectrometer, the individual spectral lines are replaced by several ver y ine lines, i.e. original lines 
are seen divided into other lines. The Hα- line in the Balmer series is found to consist of ive - 
component lines. This is called ine structure or multiple struc ture. Actually, the appearance of 
several lines in a single line suggests that only one quantum num ber is not suicient to explain the 
origin of various spectral lines.345.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
3.  Bohr  suggested circular orbits of electrons around the nucleu s of hydrogen atom, but 
researches have shown that the motion of electron is not in a single plane, but takes place in three 
dimensional space. Actually, the atomic model is not lat.
4.  When  the excited atoms of hydrogen (which give an emission line spectrum) are placed in a 
magnetic ield, its spectral lines are further split up into cl osely spaced lines. This type of splitting 
of spectral lines is called Zeeman efect. So, if the source which is producing the Na - spectrum 
is placed in a weak magnetic ield, it causes the splitting of tw o lines of Na into component lines. 
Similarly, when the excited hydrogen atoms are placed in an electr ical ield, then similar splitting 
of spectral lines takes place which is called “Stark efect”. Boh r’s theory does not explain either 
Zeeman or Stark efect.
 However, in 1915, Sommorfeld suggested  the moving electrons might d escribe in addition to 
the circular orbits elliptic orbits as well wherein the nucleus lies at one of the focii of the ellipse.
5.6 X-RA YS AND ATOMIC NUMBER
 X-rays are produced when rapidly moving electrons collide with  heavy metal anode in the 
discharge tube. Energy is released in the form of electromagnetic waves when the electrons are 
suddenly stopped. In the discharge tube, the electrons produced by a  heated tungsten ilament are 
accelerated by high voltage Fig. (5.18). It gives them suicient en ergy to bring about the emission 
of X-rays on striking the metal target. X-rays are emitted from the target in all directions, but only a 
small portion of them is used for useful purposes through the wind ows. The wavelength of X-rays 
produced depends upon the nature of the target metal. Every metal has  its own characteristic 
X-rays.355.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
The  X-rays are passed through a slit in platinum plate and then emerged through aluminum 
window. This is thrown on a crystal of K4[Fe(CN)6], which analyses the X-ray beam. The rays are 
difracted from the crystal and are obtained in the form of line sp ectrum of X-rays. This is allowed 
to fall on photographic plate. This line spectrum is the charac teristic of target material used. This 
characteristic X-rays spectrum has discrete spectral lines. T hese are grouped into K-series, L-series 
and M-series, etc. Each series has various line as K α, K β, L α, L β, M α, M β etc.
A systematic and comprehensive study of X-rays was undertaken by  Moseley in 1913-1914. His 
researches covered a range of wavelengths 0.04 - 8 A. He employed thi rty eight diferent elements 
from aluminium to gold, as target in X-rays tube. Moseley was able to draw the following important 
conclusions from a detailed analysis of the spectral lines whi ch he obtained.
(i)  The spectral lines could be classiied into two distinct  groups. One of shorter wavelengths 
are identiied by K-series and the other of comparatively longer waveleng ths are identiied by 
L-series. 
(ii)  If the target element is of higher atomic number the wavelength  of X-rays becomes shorter.
(iii)  A  very simple relationship was found between the frequenc y (v) of a particular line of X-rays 
and the atomic number Z of the element emitting it.
       v  = a(Z-b)           ..................            (27)Fig (5.18) Production of X-rays365.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 Here ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the constants characteristic of the metal und er consideration. This linear 
equation (27) is known as Moseley’s Law. ‘a” is proportionality   constant and ‘b’ is called screening 
constant of the metals.
This  law states that the frequency of a spectral line in X-ray spectrum varies as the square of 
atomic number of an element emitting it.  This law convinces us that it is the atomic number and 
not the atomic mass of the element which determines its characteristic properties, both physical 
and chemical. If value of v for K-series are plotted against Z, then a straight line is obtai ned.
Importance of Moseley Law
(i) Moseley arranged K and Ar, Ni and Co in a proper way i n Mendeleev’s periodic table.
(ii) This law has led to the discovery of many new elements like Tc(43), Pr(59), Rh(45).
(iii) The atomic number of rare earths have been determined by th is law.
5.7 WAVE-PARTICLE NATURE OF MATTER (DUAL NATURE OF 
MATTER)
 Planck’s quantum theory of radiation tells us that light shows a dual character. It behaves 
both as a material particle and as a wave. This idea was exten ded to matter particles in 1924 by 
Louis de- Broglie. According to de-Broglie, all matter particles in motion have a dual character. It 
means that electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and molecules possess the  characteristics of both 
the material particle and a wave.
This is called wave-particle duality in matter. de-Broglie deri ved a mathematical equation which 
relates the wavelength ( l) of the electron to the momentum of electron.
             h=mvl   ........................                   (28) 
 Here l = de-Broglie’s wavelength,
  m = mass of the particle
  v = velocity of electron
 According to this equation, the wavelength associated with an electron  is inversely proportional 
to its momentum (mv).375.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 This equation is derived as follows.
 According to Planck’s equation
   E = hv          ........................                   
 According to Einstein’s mass energy relationship
   2E = mc
          ........................                   (29)
 Where ’m’ is the mass of the material particle which has to con vert itself into a photon; ‘and c’ 
is the velocity of photon. Equating two values of energy;
       2hv=mc
 Since
       lcv=
 So,    l2 hc = mc
  or 
 lh=mc         ........................        (30)
According  to equation (30), the wavelength of photon is inversely pr oportional to the momentum of 
photon. Considering that nature is symmetrical, we apply this equ ation (30) to the moving electron 
of mass’m’ and velocity V. This idea gives us the de-Broglie’s eq uation (28)
       lh=mv            ........................                   (28)
 According  to equation (28), the wavelength of electron is inversely proportional to momentum 
of electron. Now, consider an electron which is moving with a velocity  of 2.188x106 ms-1 in the irst 
orbit of Bohr’s model of hydrogen atom. Then, wavelength associating  with it, can be calculated 
with the help of equation(28)

    l=0.33 nm
 This value of wavelength ( l)of electron while moving in the irst orbit of H-atom is comparable 
to the wavelength of X-rays and can be measured.385.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 If we imagine a proton moving in a straight line with the same vel ocity as mentioned for 
electron, it’s wavelength will be 1836 times smaller than that of elec tron. Similarly, an α-particle 
moving with the same velocity should have a wavelength 7344 times smal ler as compared to that 
of ejectron. Now, consider a stone of mass one gram moving with a veloc ity of 10 ms-1, then its 
wavelength will be:

This wavelength is so small, that it cannot be measured by any c onceivable method. It means that 
heavy material particles have waves associated with them, but they ca nnot be captured and we say 
that the macroscopic bodies don’t have the waves.
5.7.1 Experimental Veriication of Dual Nature of Matt er
 In 1927, two  American scientists, Davisson and Germer did a n experiment to verify the wave 
nature of moving electron. Electrons were produced from heated tungsten il ament and accelerated 
by applying the potential diference through charged plates. Davisson  and Germer proved that the 
accelerated electrons undergo difraction, like waves, when they fall on a nickel crystal. In this way, 
the wave nature of electron got veriied. Davisson ahd Germer got the nobel priz e for inventing 
an apparatus to prove the matter waves and de Broglie got the separate nob el prize for giving the 
equation of matter wave.
5.8 HEISENBERG'S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE
 According to Bohr’s theory, an electron is a material particle and its position as well as 
momentum can be determined with great accuracy. But with the advent of  the concept of wave 
nature of electron, it has not been possible for us to measure simul taneously the exact position 
and velocity of electron. This was suggested by Heisenberg, in 1 927. 
 Suppose, that Δx is the uncertainty in the measurement of the position and Δp is the uncertainty 
in the measurement of momentum of an electron, then
        p∆∆ ≥hxp4395.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
This  relationship is called uncertainty principle. This equ ation shows that if Δx is small then Δp 
will be large and vice versa. So, if one quantity is measured ac curately then the other becomes 
less accurate. Hence, certainty in the determination of one quantity i ntroduces uncertainty in the 
determination of the other quantity.
 The uncertainty principle is applicable only for microscop ic particles like electrons, protons 
and neutrons, etc. and has no signiicance for large particles,  i.e. macroscopic particles.
 Compton’s  efect can help us understand the uncertainty principl e, Suppose, we wish to 
determine the position of electron. Visible light cannot help us, beca use the wavelength of visible 
light is millions time large as compared to the diameter of electron.  For this purpose, we have to 
use X-rays which have very short wavelength as  compared to that of visible light. When this photon 
of X-rays strikes an electron, the momentum of electron will chang e. In other words, uncertainty 
of momentum will appear due to change of velocity of electron. Smaller  the wavelength of X-rays, 
greater will be the energy of the photon. Hence, the collision of X-rays  with electron will bring about 
the greater uncertainty in momentum. So, an efort to determine the exact posi tion of electron has 
rendered its momentum uncertain. When we use the photons of longer wa velength to avoid the 
change of momentum, the determination of the position of electron becomes im possible.
Concept of Orbital
 Following this principle, the Bohr’s picture of an atom does not appear to be satisfactory. 
In Bohr’s atom, the electrons are moving with speciic velocities in orb its of speciied radii, and 
according to uncertainty principle, both these 
quantities cannot be measured experimentally. 
A theory involving quantities, which cannot be 
measured does not follow the tradition of scientiic 
work.
 In  order to solve this diiculty, Schrodinger, 
Heisenberg and Dirac worked out wave theories 
of the atom. The best known treatment is that 
of Schrodinger. He set up a wave equation 
for hydrogen atom. According to Schrodinger, 
although the position of an electron cannot be 
found exactly, the probability of inding an electron 
at a certain position at any time can be found. 
Fig (5.19) Probable electron density diagram for hydrog en atom.405.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
The solution of the wave equation gives probability of inding an electr on present in a given small 
region of space. When the probability of inding the electron at a di stance r from the nucleus is 
calculated for the hydrogen atom in the ground state, Fig (5.19)  is obtained.
The maximum probability of inding the electron is at a distance of 0.053 nm. It is the same radius 
as calculated for the Bohr’s irst orbit. There is a possibility that the electron is either closer to the 
nucleus or outside the radius of 0.053 nm, where probability of inding electron decreases sharply. 
 
    The volume of space in which there is 95% chance of inding  an electron is called atomic orbital. 
The term orbital should not be confused with the term orbit as used i n the Bohr’s theory. The 
orbital can be regarded as a spread of charge surrounding th e nucleus. This is often called the 
“electron cloud”.
5.8.1 Quantum Numbers  
Schrodinger  wave equation, has been solved for hydrogen a t o m .  I t  m a y  h a v e  d i f f e r e n t  
solutions. Quantum numbers are the sets of numerical values whic h give the acceptable solutions 
to Schrodinger wave equation for hydrogen atom.  An electron in an a tom is completely described 
by its four quantum numbers. You know that a complete address of a person comprises his name, 
city in which he lives, the block, street and the house number. O n the similar grounds, quantum  
numbers serve as identiicatio numbers or labels, which completely  describe an electron. These 
quantum numbers specify position of electron in an atom. 
There are four quantum numbers which can describe the electron c ompletely. 
(1)  Principal quantum number (n) 
(2)  Azimuthal quantum number ( ) 
(3)  Magnetic quantum number (m) 
(4)  Spin quantum number (s)  Let us discuss these quantum numbers one by one.
Principal Quantum Number (n)
The diferent energy levels in Bohr’s atom are represented by ‘n’. Thi s is called principal quantum 
number by Schrodinger. Its values are non-zero, positive integers u pto ininity.    
 
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,.........................,415.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
The  value of n represents the shell or energy level in which the elec tron revolves around the 
nucleus. Letter notations K, L, M, N, etc are also used to denote the vari ous shells. For example, 
when n =1, it is called K shell, for n = 2, it is L shell  and so on. The values of n also determine the 
location of electron in an atom, i.e the distance of electron from the nu cleus, greater the value of 
‘n’ greater will be the distance of electron from the nucleus. It is a quantitative measure of the size 
of an electronic shell, ‘n’ also provides us the energy of electron in  a shell. Bohr’s results help us to 
know the relationships of distance and energy of electron.
Azimuthal Quantum Number (  )
 It has already been mentioned in the defects of Bohr’s model that a s pectrometer of high 
resolving power shows that an individual line in the spectrum is f urther divided into several very ine 
lines. This thing can be explained by saying that each shell  is divided into subshells. So, only principal 
quantum number (n) is not suicient to explain the line spectrum.  There is another subsidiary 
quantum number called azimuthal quantum number and is u sed to represent the subshells. The 
values of azimuthal quantum number ( ) are
    =0, 1, 2, 3, ...................................... ...............(n-1)
 Its value depends upon n. These values represent diferent subshells , which are designated 
by small letters, s, p, d, f. They stand for sharp, princi pal, difused and fundamental, respectively. 
These are the spectral terms used to describe the series of lines observed  in the atomic spectrum. 
The values of azimuthal quantum number always start from zero.
 A subshell may have diferent shapes depending upon the value of (‘’). It may be spherical, 
dumb-bell, or some other complicated shapes. The value of  ‘ ’ is related to the shape of the 
subshell as follows:
   = 0    s-subshell    spherical
   = 1    p-subshell    dumb-bell
   = 2    d-subshell    (complicated shape)425.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
 The relationship between principal and azimuthal quantum n umbers is as follows.

 In 1s, 2s, ........, etc, the digit represents the value of pr incipal quantum number.’  ’ values also 
enable us to calculate the total number of electrons in a given subs hell. The formula for calculating 
electrons is 2 (2  + 1).
 
  when  = 0   s-subshell   total electrons = 2
     = 1   p-subshell   total electrons = 6
     = 2   d-subshell   total electrons = 10
     = 3   f-subshell   total electrons = 14
Magnetic Quantum Number (m)
 In the defects of Bohr’s model, it has been mentioned that strong magn etic ield splits the 
spectral lines further. In order to explain this splitting, a third quantum number called the magnetic 
quantum number (m) has been proposed.
 Its values are
    m = 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3,..........................
 The value of’m’ depends upon values of ‘ ’435.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
when  = 0  s-subshell   m=0
   = 1  p-subshell   m=0, ±1(p-subshell has three degenerate orb itals)
   = 2  d-subshell   m=0,±1, ±2(d-subshell has ive degenerate orbitals)
   = 3  f-subshell  m=0,±1, ±2, ±3(f-subshell has  seven d egenerate orbitals)
 This above description shows that for a given value of ‘’ the total values of’m’ are (2  +1).
 Actually, the value of m gives us the information of degeneracy of  orbitals in space. It tells 
us the number of diferent  ways in which a given s, p, d or f -subshell can be arranged along x, y 
and z-axes in the presence of a magnetic ield. Thus, diferent va lues of’m’ for a given value of ‘ ‘, 
represent the total number of diferent space orientations for a subshell.
 In case of s-subshell  = 0, so, m = 0. It implies that s-subshell of any energy level  has only one 
space orientation and can be arranged in space only in one way along x, y and z-axes. So s-subshell 
is not sub-divided into any other orbital. The shape of’s’ orbital  is such that the probability of inding  
the electron in all the directions from the nucleus is the same. It i s a spherical and symmetrical 
orbital. Fig (5.20).
 For p-subshell,   = 1 and m = 0, ±1. These values of’m’ imply that p-subsh ell of any energy 
level has three space orientations  and can be arranged in spac e along x, y, and z axes Fig. (5.21). 
These three orbitals are perpendicular to each other and named as px, py, and pz. They have egg 
shaped lobes which touch each other at the origin. They are dispos ed symmetrically along one of 
the three axes called orbital axis. In the absence of the magnetic iel d, all the three p-orbitals have 
the same energy and are called degenerate orbitals. Since, they are th ree in number, so these 
orbitals are said to be 3-fold degenerate or triply degenerate.
 For d-subshell  = 2 m = 0, ±1, ±2. It  implies that it has ive space orientati ons and are 
designated as dxy (m = -2), dyz (m = -1), dzx(m = +1), dx2
-y2(m = +2) and dz2(m - 0) Fig. (5.22).
 All  these ive d-orbitals are not identical in shape. In the absen ce of a magnetic ield, all ive 
d-orbitals have the same energy and they are said to be ive fold degener ate orbitals.
  For f-subshell,  = 3 and m = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3. They have complicated shapes. 
 The whole discussion shows that magnetic quantum number determin es the orientation of 
orbitals, so it is also called orbital orientation quantum number.
Spin Quantum Number (s)
Alkali metals have one electron in their outermost shell. We can record  their emission spectra, 
when the outermost electron jumps from an excited state to a ground state. W hen the spectra are 
observed by means of high resolving power spectrometer, each line in  the spectrum is found to 
consist of pair of lines, this is called doublet line structure. We should keep it in mind, that doublet 
line structure is diferent from the ine spectrum of hydrogen (as w e have discussed in azimuthal 
quantum number).445.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
It should be made clear that lines of doublet line structure are wi dely separated from each other, 
while those of ine structure are closely spaced together.
 In  1925, Goudsmit and Uhlenbech suggested that an electron while moving in an orbital 
around the nucleus also rotates or spins about its own axis either i n a clockwise or anti-clockwise 
direction. This is also called self-rotation. This spinning el ectron is associated with a magnetic ield 
and hence a magnetic moment. Hence, opposite magnetic ields are genera ted by the clockwise 
and anti-clockwise spins of electrons. This spin motion is res ponsible for doublet line structure in 
the spectrum.
 The  four quantum numbers of all the electrons in the irst four shells are summarized in 
Table (5.3). Notice, that each electron has its own set of quantum n umbers and this set is diferent 
for each electron.

5.8.2 Shapes of Orbitals
 In section 5.8.1, we were introduced to the four types of orbitals  depending upon the values 
of azimuthal quantum number. These orbitals are s, p, d and  f having azimuthal quantum number 
values as  = 0,1, 2,3, respectively. Let us, discuss the shapes of these, or bitals.
Shapes of s-Orbitals
 s-orbital has a spherical shape and is usually repres ented by a circle, which in turn, represents 
a cut of sphere, Fig. (5.20). With the increase of value of pri ncipal quantum number (n), the size of 
s-orbital increases. 2s-orbital is larger in size than ls- orbital. 2s-orbital is also further away form the 
nucleus Fig. (5.20). The probability for inding the electron i s zero between two orbitals. This place 
is called nodal plane or nodal surface.
Fig (5.20) Shapes of s-orbitals with
increasing principal quantum number465.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
Shapes of p-Orbitals
 There  are three values of magnetic quantum numbef for p-subshel l. So, p-subshell has 
three orientations in space i.e. along x, y and z-axes. All the th ree p-orbitals namely, px, py and pz 
have dumb-bell shapes, Fig. (5.21). So, p-orbitals have direc tional character which determines the 
geometry of molecules. All the p-orbitals of  all the energy levels ha ve similar shapes, but with the 
increase of principal quantum number of the shell their sizes  are increased.
Shapes of d-Orbitals
 For d subshell there are ive values of magnetic quantum number. S o, there are ive space 
orientations along x, yand z-axes. Fig (5.22). They are desi gnated as dxy, dyz, dxz, 22x -yd , 2zd.The lobes 
of irst three d-orbitals lie between the axis. The other lie on the axis.
They  are not identical in shape. Four d-orbitals out of these ive con tain four lobes each, while the 
ifth orbital dz2 consists of only two lobes, Fig (5.22). In the absence of magneti c ield, all the ive 
d-orbitals are degenerate. The shape of f-orbital is very complicated .
Fig (5.20) Shapes of p-orbitals475.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
5.9 ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION
In order to understand the distribution of electrons in an atom, we s hould know the following facts. 
1.  An orbital like s, px, py, pz and dxy, etc. can have at the most two electrons.
2. The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in  a shell is given by 2n2 formula 
where n is principal quantum number and it cannot have zero va lue.
 Moreover, following rules have been adopted  
to distribute the electrons in subshells or orbitals.
 1.  Aufbau principle
 2.  Pauii’s exclusion principle
 3.  Hand’s rule
 But, before we use these rules, the subshells should be arranged according to (n + ) rule, 
Table(5.4). This rule says that subshells are arranged in  the increasing order of (n + ) values and if 
any two subshells have the same (n + ) values, then that subshell is placed irst whose n value is 
smaller. 
 The arrangement of subshells in ascending order of their energy  may be as follows: 1s, 2s, 2p, 
3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s and so no.
Fig (5.22) Shapes of d-orbitals485.ATOMIC STRUCTURE eLearn.Punjab
Aufbau Principle
  The electrons should be illed in energy 
subshells in order of increasing energy values. 
The electrons are irst placed in Is, 2s, 2p and 
soon.
Pauli’s Exclusion Principle
 This principle can be stated as follows:
 It is impossible for two electrons residing 
in the same orbital of a poly-electron atom to 
have the same values of four quantum num-
bers, or Two electrons in the same orbital 
should have opposite spins ( ↓↑).
Hund’s Rules
 If, degenerate orbitals are available and more than one electrons a re to be placed in them, 
they should be placed in separate orbitals with the same spin ra ther than putting them in the same 
orbital with opposite spins.
 According to the rule, the two electrons in 2p subshell of carbon will be distributed as follows.
