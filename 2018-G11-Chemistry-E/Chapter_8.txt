8.1.0 REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE REACTIONS
 A chemical reaction can take place in both directions, i.e. for ward and reverse, but in some 
cases the tendency of reverse reaction is very small and is neglig ible. For example, sodium reacts 
with water to form sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
     22 2Na(s)+2H O( )  2NaOH(aq)+H (g) → 
 The  tendency for hydrogen to react with sodium hydroxide to form sodium and water is 
negligible at normal temperature. This is an example of irreversi ble reaction.
 Let us  take another example of the reaction between two parts of hydrog en and one part 
of oxygen by means of an electric spark at normal temperature and pressure. The reaction occurs 
stoichiometrically according to the following chemical equation.
     22 22H (g) + O (g)    2H O( ) → 
 If hydrogen and oxygen are present in correct proportion, there wil l be no residual gases i.e. 
hydrogen and oxygen. If the product is heated to a temperature of 150 00C, a noticeable quantity 
of H2O decomposes, producing hydrogen and oxygen. It means that rever se reaction does occur, 
but only at higher temperature. It is very likely that the reverse reac tion occurs at low temperature, 
but it is too small to be noticeable. The reaction between stoichiometric a mounts of hydrogen 
and oxygen proceeds to completion in the presence of electric spark.  Such reactions are called 
irreversible reactions and they take place in one direction only.
 Now, consider  a reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen at 4500C under high pressure in 
the presence of iron as a catalyst.
 There action mixture, after some time, will contain all the three sp ecies i.e. nitrogen, hydrogen 
and ammonia. No matter, how long the reaction is allowed to continu e, the percentage composition 
of species present remains constant. The conditions are favourable for the forward as well as for a 
reverse reaction to occur to a measurable extent. This type of reaction is described as a reversible 
reaction.oFe/450 C

8.1.1  State of Chemical Equilibrium
 If a reversible reaction is allowed to continue for a considerable long time, without changing 
the conditions, there is no further change in composition of the reacti on mixture. The reaction is 
said to have attained a state of chemical equilibrium. Once this  equilibrium has been established, 
it will last forever if undisturbed.
 To illustrate an example of the attainment of 
equilibrium, let us consider a general reaction in 
which A reacts with B to produce C and D.
  A(g)  +  B(g)  C(g)  +  D(g) ฀
Suppose that all the substances are in gaseous state.
 Let  the initial concentrations of A and B be equal . 
As time goes on, concentrations of A and B decrease, 
at irst quite rapidly but later slowly. Eventually, the 
concentrations of A and B level of and become 
constant.
 The graph is plotted between time and 
concentrations for reactants and products, Fig(8.1). The initia l concentrations of C and D are zero. 
As the time passes the products C and D are formed. Their concentrati ons increase rapidly at irst 
and then level of. At the time of equilibrium concentrations become consta nt. This is how the 
chemical equilibrium is attained and state of equilibrium is  reached.
 Now, let us consider the example of a reversible reaction between hyd rogen gas and iodine 
vapours to form hydrogen iodide at 4250 C. At equilibrium three components will be present in 
deinite proportions in the reaction m ixture Fig (8.2). The equilib rium is established when the 
rising curve of product HI and the falling curve of reactants [ H2] and [I2] become parallel to time 
axis.

 The  same equilibrium mixture is obtained irrespective whether the reaction starts by 
mixing hyd rogen and iodine or by decomposition of hydrogen iodi de. The situation suggests two 
possibilities of the state of reaction at equilibrium
(i) All reactions cease at equilibrium so that the system becomes stationary.
(ii) The forward and reverse reactions are taking  place simulta neously at exactly the same rate.
 It is now universally accepted that the later conditions prevail in  a reversible reaction at 
equilibrium stage of reaction. It is known as the state of dynami c equilibrium.

8.1.2  Law of Mass Action
 A state of dynamic equilibrium helps to determine the composition of  reacting substances 
and the products at equilibrium. We use the relationship which was derived by C.M. Guldberg 
and R Waage in 1864.  It is known as the law of mass action. It states that th e rate at which 
the reaction proceeds is directly proportional to the  product of the active masses of the 
reactants.
 The term active mass represents the concentration in mole dm-3 of the reactants and products 
for a dilute solution.
 Now, consider a general reaction in which A and B are the reac tants and C and D are the 
products. The reaction is represented by the following chemical equ ation.
    fk
kA + B  C + D
r฀฀฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀฀
 The equilibrium concentrations of A, B, C and D are represented  in square brackets like [A], 
[B], [C] and [D] respectively and they are expressed in moles dm-3. According to the law of mass 
action, the rate of the forward reaction, is proportional to the product of  molar concentrations of A 
and B.
    f Rate of forward reaction (R )    [A][B] ∝
    or  ffR  = k [A] [B]
kf is the  proportionality constant and is called rate constant for f orward reaction and Rf is the rate 
of forward reaction. Similarly, the rate of reverse reaction (Rr) is given by
    r Rate of reverse reaction (R )    [C][D] ∝
      rrR  = k [C] [D]
Where  kr is the proportionality constant and is called the rate con stant for backward reaction. 
Remember that C and D are the reactants for backward step.68.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
  At equilibrium,
      frR  = R
   or  frk [A] [B]  =  k [C] [D]
  On rearranging, we get

 The constant Kc is called the equilibrium constant of the  reaction. Kc is the ratio of two rate 
constants.
Conventionally, while writing equilibrium constant, the products  are written as numerator and 
reactants as denominator.

The equilibrium constant is given by

 Hence, the  coeicients in the equation appear as exponents of the terms of  concentrations 
in the equilibrium constant expression.
Units of Equilibrium Constants
 Equilibrium constant is the ratio of the products of the concentration s of the products to 
the product of concentrations of the reactants. If the reaction has equal  number of moles on the 
reactant and product sides, then equilibrium constant has no uni ts. When the number of moles is 
unequal then it has units related to the concentration or pressure. B ut it is a usual practice that we 
don’t write the units with Kp or Kc values.
 Following are some important reversible reactions. Their units of Kc are expressed as

8.1.3 Equilibrium Constant Expressions for Some Impor tant Reactions
i.  Formation of Ester from an Organic Acid and Alc ohol (aqueous phase reaction)
 This is a well known reversible reaction in the solution state.

 Let us suppose that ‘a’ moles of CH3COOH and ‘b’ moles of C2H5OH are initially taken in a 
vessel in the presence of small amount of a mineral acid as a ca talyst.
 The  progress of the reaction can be studied by inding out the conc entrations of acetic acid 
after regular intervals.
 A very small portion of the reaction mixture is withdrawn and th e concentration of acetic acid 
is determined by titrating it against a standard solution of sodiu m hydroxide. The concentration of 
acetic acid will decrease until the attainment of state of equilibri um, when it will become constant. 
At equilibrium stage, x moles of ester and ‘x’ moles of H2O are produced. The number of moles of 
acid and alcohol left behind are ‘a-x’ moles and ‘b-x’ moles  respectively. If the volume of reaction 
mixture at equilibrium stage is ‘V’ dm3, then

 When number of moles are divided by total volume of the reaction mixtu re, we get concentration 
of each species at equilibrium stage in moles dm-3.

cXK=(a-x)(b-x)
  In this expression of Kc, the factor of volume is cancelled out. So, the change of volume 
at equilibrium stage does not afect the Kc value or equilibrium position of reaction.
ii.  Dissociation of PCl5 (gaseous phase reaction)
 The dissociation of PCl5 into PCI3 and Cl2, is a well known homogeneous gaseous phase 
reaction. This reaction has unequal number of moles of reactants and products.

 Let ‘a’ moles of  PCl5 present initially are decomposed by ‘x’ moles. So, at equilibriu m stage, ‘a-
x’ moles of PCl5 are left behind while ‘x‘ moles of PCI3 and ‘x’ moles of Cl2 are produced. If the volume

 The  inal expression is not independent of the factor of volume. So, th e change of volume 
at equilibrium stage disturbs the equilibrium position of the rea ction. We will discuss this reaction 
in Le-Chatelier’s principle with reference to efect of volume change an d its efect on change of 
equilibrium position.
iii.  Decomposition of N2O4 (gaseous phase reaction)
 Similarly, for decomposition of N2O4 (g). the expression of Kc involves the factor of volume.

     2
c4xK=(a-x)V128.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 ‘a’ is the initial number of moles of N2O4 ‘x’ is number of moles of N2O4 decomposed and ‘V’ is 
total volume of N2O4 , and NO2 at equilibrium stage.
iv.  Synthesis of NH3 ( gaseous phase reaction)
 For the synthesis of ammonia,
    22 3N (g) + 3H (g)   2NH (g) ฀
 the expression of Kc is
     22
c 34x VK=(a-x)(b-3x)
 Where ’a’ and ’b’ are the initial number of moles of N2 and H2 and ’x’ is number of moles of N2, 
decomposed at equilibrium stage. ‘V’ is the total volume of N2, H2 and NH3 at equilibrium. The inal 
expression involves V2 in the numerator:
 Hence, it depends upon the coeicients of balanced equation that whether the factor of 
volume will appear in numerator or denomenator.
8.1.4 Relationship Between Equilibrium Constants
 The expressions of equilibrium constants depend upon the concentrati on units used. Mostly 
the concentrations are expressed in mole dm-3. Let us consider the following reversible reaction.
     aA + bB      cC + dD ฀
     c d cd
CD
cc a b ab
AB[C] [D] C DK=     o r   K=  [A] [B] A B
The  square brackets represent the concentration of species in moles d m-3. Anyhow, the capital C 
is also used for molar concentrations.138.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 If  the reactants A, B, and the products C, D of the reaction und er consideration are ideal 
gases, then molar concentration of each gas is proportional to its pa rtial pressure . When the 
concentrations are expressed in terms of partial pressures, the expr ession of Kp is,
      cd
CD
p ab
ABppK = pp
 Here PA, PB, PC and PD are  partial pressures of A, B, C, D respectively at equilibriu m position. As 
long as the number of moles of products and reactants, which a re in the gaseous state, are equal, 
the values of KC and KP remain the same. Otherwise, the following relationship between KP and KC 
can be derived by using Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
      n
pcK =K (RT)∆
 Where ‘ ∆n’ is the diference between number of moles of the gaseous products and  the 
number of moles of gaseous reactants.
 ∆n = no. of moles of products  -  no. of moles of reactants
 ‘R’ is the  general gas constant and ‘T’ is absolute temperatur e at which the reaction is being 
carried out
 Where, ∆n = 0, then all the equilibrium constants have the same values.
Example 2:
 N2 (g) and H2 (g) combine to give NH3 (g). The value of Kc in this reaction at 500 °C is 6.0 x 10-2. 
Calculate the value of Kp for this reaction.
Solution:
   The reaction for the synthesis of NH3 is
   22 3N (g) + 3H (g)   2NH (g) ฀
This reaction takes place with decrease in the number of moles. Th e relationship of Kpand Kc is
      
      n
pcK =K (RT)∆148.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 Now      Kp = 6.0 x 10-2
    Temperature    = 500 + 273=773 K
 ∆n = no of moles of products - no of moles of reactants
      ∆n = 2 - 4 = -2
      R    = 0.0821 dm3 atm K-1 mol-1
 Substituting these values in the expression
      Kp = 6.0 x 10-2 (773 x 0.0821)-2      = 6.0 x 10-2 (63.5)-2
      -2
p 26.0x10K=(63.5)
      -5
pK =1.5x10 Answer
 In  this case the value of Kp is smaller than Kc . Those reactions, which take place with the 
increase in the number of moles mostly have greater Kp than Kc.
8.1.5 APPLICATIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT
The  value of equilibrium constant is speciic and remains cons tant at a particular temperature.
 The study of equilibrium constant provides us the following infor mations:
 (i)  Direction of reaction  (ii)  Extent of reaction
 (iii)  Efect of various factors on equilibrium constant and equ ilibrium position.

(i)  Direction of Reaction
 we know that, c[Products]K =     [Reactants]  for any reaction.
 The  direction of a chemical reaction at any particular time c an be predicted by means of 
[products] / [reactants] ratio, calculated before the reaction attain s equilibrium. The value of 
[product] / [reactants] ratio leads to one of the following three possib ilities.
(a)  The ratio is less than Kc. This implies that more of the product is required to attain the equi librium, 
therefore, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction.
(b)  The ratio is greater than Kc. It means that the reverse reaction will occur to attain the equilibr ium.
(c)  When the ratio is equal to Kc, then the reaction is at equilibrium.
Example 3:
 Esteriication reaction between ethanol and acetic acid was carried out by mixing deinite 
amounts of ethanol and acetic acid alongwith some mineral acid as a catalyst. Samples were drawn 
out of the reaction mixturq to check the progress of the esteriication reacti on. In one of the samples 
drawn after time t, the concentrations of the species were found to be [ CH3COOH] = 0.025 mol dm-3, 
[C2H5OH]= 0.032 mol dm-3, [CH3COOC2H5] = 0.05 mol dm-3, and [H20] = 0.04 mol dm-3. Find out the 
direction of the reaction if Kc for the reaction at 25°C is 4.

 Esteriication reaction is represented by the following stoichiometric eq uation.

     c0.05x0.04K   = =2.50 Answer0.025x0.032168.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
The given value of KC for this reaction is 4 and 2.5 is less  than KC. Therefore, the reaction will 
proceed in the forward direction to attain the equilibrium.
(ii)  Extent of Reaction
(a)  If the equilibrium constant is very large, this indicates that the reaction is almost 
complete.
(b)  If  the value of Kc is small, it relects that the reaction does not proceed appreciably i n 
the forward direction.
(c)  If the value of Kc is very small, this shows a very little forward reaction.
Examples:
 Equilibrium constant for the decomposition of ozone to oxygen is 1055 at 25°C.
i.e.,   55 o
3 2c2O 3O ,   K =10     at 25 C ฀
 It infers that at room temperature 03 is unstable and decomposes very rapidly to 02. This 
reaction is almost complete.
 On the other hand the value of equilibrium constant for the decomposi tion of HF at 2000°C is 10-13.
   -13 o
22 c 2HF(g) H (g) + F (g)    K =10   at 2000 C ฀
 It indicates high stability and slow decomposition of HF, even at 2000°C.
(iii)  The Effect of Conditions on the Position of Equilibrium
 Equilibrium constant and position of equilibrium are two difer ent entities. Kc is equilibrium 
constant and has constant value at a particular temperature whereas  the ratio of products to 
reactants in equilibrium mixture is described as the position of  equilibrium and it can change if the 
external conditions e.g. temperature, pressure and concentrations are a ltered. If Kc is  large the 
position of equilibrium lies on the right and if it is small , the position of the equilibrium lies on the 
left, for a reversible reaction.178.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 Chemists are interested in inding the best conditions to obtain maxim um yield of the 
products in reversible reaction, by favourably shifting the posi tion of equilibrium of a reaction. For 
this purpose, we have to discuss an important principle in this respect i.e.Le-Chatelier’s principle.
8.1.6 The Le-Chatelier's Principle
 Le-Chatelier studied the efects of concentration, pressure and temperatur e on equilibria.
 This principle states that if a stress is applied to a s ystem at equilibrium, the system 
acts in such a way so as to nullify, as far as possible, t he efect of that stress.
 The  system cannot completely cancel the efect of change, but will m inimize it. The Le-
Chatelier’s principle has wide range of applications for asc ertaining the position and composition 
of the physical and chemical equilibria.
(a)  Effect of Change in Concentration
 In order to understand the efect of change in concentration on the reversi ble reaction, 
consider the reaction in which BiCl3 reacts with water to give a white insoluble compound BiOCl.
     32BiCl  + H O BiOCl + 2HCl ฀
Animation 8.6: The Le-Chatelier’s Principle
Source & Credit : Anotherequilibriumsite188.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 The equilibrium constant expression for above reaction can be wr itten as
      2
c
32[BiOCl][HCl]K[BiCl ][H O]=
 Aqueous  solution of BiCl3 is cloudy, because of hydrolysis and formation of BiOCl. If  a small 
amount of HCl is added  to this solution, it will disturb the eq uilibrium and force the system to move 
in such a way so that efect of addition of HCl is minimized. T he reaction will move in the backward 
direction to restore the equilibrium again and a clear solution wil l be obtained. However, if water 
is added to the above solution the system will move in the forward di rection and the solution will 
again become cloudy. The shifting of reaction to forward and ba ckward direction by disturbing the 
concentration is just according to Le-Chatelier’s principle.
 So, in general, we  conclude that addition of a substance among  the reactants, or the removal 
of a substance among the products at equilibrium stage disturbs the equilibrium position and 
reaction is shifted to forward direction. Similarly, the additi on of a substance among the products or 
the removal of a substance among the reactants will derive the equili brium towards the backward 
direction. Removing one of the products formed can therefore increase th e yield of a reversible 
reaction. The value of K however remains constant. This concept is ex tensively applied in common 
ion efect and follows the Le-Chatelier’s principle.
(b)  Effect of Change in Pressure or Volume
 The change in pressure or volume are important only for the reversib le gaseous reactions 
where the number of moles of reactants and products are not equal. Le-Chatelier’s principle 
plays an important role, to predict the position and direction of th e reaction. Take the example of 
formation of SO3 gas from SO2 gas and O2 gas.
    22 32SO (g) + O (g) 2SO (g) ฀
 This gas phase reaction proceeds with the decrease in the number of moles and hence 
decreases in volume at equilibrium stage. When the reaction approa ches the equilibrium stage, 
the volume of the equilibrium mixture is less than the volume of reac tants taken initially. If one 
decreases the volume further at equilibrium stage, the reaction is d isturbed. It will move to the 
forward direction to minimize the efect of disturbance. It establishes  a new equilibrium position 
while Kc remains constant. The reverse happens when the volume is increa sed or pressure is 
decreased at equilibrium stage.198.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
(c)  Quantitative Effect of Volume on Equilibrium Posit ion
 The quantitative efect of  change of volume or pressure can be inferred  from the mathematical 
expression of Kc for SO3 (g) synthesis.
     22 32SO (g) + O (gas) 2SO (g) ฀
     4x VK=(a-2x) (b-x)
 Where ‘V’ is the  volume of reaction mixture at equilibrium stage , ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the number of 
moles of SO2 and O2 present initially and Y are the number of moles of oxygen which has reacted 
at equilibrium. According to the above equation, when volume is inc reased, then ‘x’ has to be 
decreased to keep Kc constant. The decrease of x means that reaction is pushed to the bac kward 
direction. From the amount of the increase in volume, we can calcula te the amount of x which has 
to be decreased to keep Kc constant
 Similarly,increasing the  pressure on the above reaction at equi librium, will decrease tlie 
volume and hence the value of Kc will increase. In order to keep the value of Kc constant, the 
reaction will move in the forward direction.
 In the  same way, we can explain the efect of change of pressure on the equilibrium positions 
for the dissociation of PCl5 and N2O4 reactions. These reactions are homogenous gaseous phase 
reactions.
 PCI5 dissolves to give PCI3 and Cl2

 Kc for this reaction is as follows:

 The Kc for this reaction is as follows
      2
c4xK=V(a-x)
 Both these reactions have the factor of volume present in the denominator.  The reason is 
that numbers of moles of products are greater than those of reactants. S o, increase in pressure 
will decrease x to keep the value of Kc constant and  the reaction will be pushed to the backward 
direction. The equilibrium position is disturbed but not the Kc value.
 Remember  that, those gaseous reactions in which number of moles of reactants and products 
are same, are not afected by change in pressure or volume. Same is the case for reactions in which 
the participating substances are either liquids or solids.
(d)  Effect of Change in Temperature
 Most  of the reversible chemical reactions are disturbed by chan ge in temperature. If we 
consider heat as a component of equilibrium system, a rise in temperature adds heat to the system 
and a drop in temperature removes heat from the system. According to Le-Chatelier’s principle, 
therefore, a temperature increase favours the endothermic reactions an d a temperature decrease 
favours the exothermic reactions.
 The  equilibrium constant changes by the change of temperatur e, because the equilibrium 
position shifts without any substance being added or removed. Consi der the following exothermic 
reaction in gas phase at equilibrium taking place at a known temperature.
   -1
2 22 CO(g) + H O(g)    CO (g) + H (g)                      H= -41.84 kJ mole ∆ ฀
 At equilibrium stage, if we take out heat and keep the system at this  new  lower temperature, 
the system will readjust itself, so as to compensate the loss of heat ener gy. Thus, more of CO and 
H2O molecules will react to form CO2 and H2 molecules, thereby, liberating heat because reaction 
is exothermic in the forward direction. It means by decreasing temp erature, we shift the initial 
equilibrium position to the right until a new equilibrium position  is established. On the contrary, 
heating the reaction at equilibrium will shift the reaction to the b ackward direction because the 
backward reaction is endothermic.218.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 An interesting feature of Le-Chatelier’s principle is the efect of temp erature on the solubility. 
Consider a salt such as KI. It dissolves in water and absorb s heat.
    1Kl(s)     Kl(aq)                          H=21.4kJ mol−∆ ฀
 Let us  have a saturated solution of KI in water at a given tempera ture. It has attained 
equilibrium at this temperature. A rise in temperature at equilibr ium favours more dissolution of 
the salt.
 Equilibrium is shifted to the forward direction. On the other han d, cooling will favour 
crystallization of salt. Hence the solubility of KI in water mus t increase with increase in temperature. 
For some salts the heat of solution is close to zero (heat is neither evolved or  absorbed). The 
solubility of these salts in water is not afected by the change in tem perature. Formation of aqueous 
solution of NaCl is an example of such a salt.
 Those substances, whose heats of solutions are negative (exothermic), decrease their 
solubilities by increasing temperature, as LiCl and Li2CO3 etc.
(e)  Effect of Catalyst on Equilibrium Constant
 In most of the reversible reactions the equilibrium is not alway s reached within a suitable 
short time. So, an appropriate catalyst is added. A catalyst does not afect the equilibrium position 
of the reaction. It increases the rates of both forward and backwar d reactions and this reduces the 
time to attain the state of equilibrium.
 Actually, a catalyst lowers the energy of activation of both forwar d and reverse steps by giving 
new path to the reaction.
8.2  APPLICATIONS OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM IN INDUST RY
 Concept of chemical equilibrium is widely applicable for pr eparation of certain materials on 
industrial scale. Let us discuss the manufacture of NH3 and SO3 gases on industrial scale.228.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
8.2.1  Synthesis of Ammonia by Haber’s Process
 The process of ammonia synthesis was developed by German chemist F . Haber and irst used 
in 1933. This process provides an excellent setting in which to a pply equilibrium principle and see 
the compromises needed to make an industrial process economically wor th while. The chemical 
equation is as follows.
  22 3N (g)   +   3H (g)  2NH (g)                    H=-92.46kJ∆ ฀
 When  we look at the balanced chemical equation it is inferred, from Le-Chatelier’s principle 
that one can have three ways to maximize the yield of ammonia.
(i)  By  continual withdrawl of ammonia after intervals, the equ ilibrium will shift to forward 
direction in accordance with Le-Chatelier’s principle. To unders tand it look at the efect of change 
of concentration in Le-Chatelier’s principle.
ii)  In crease the pressure to decrease the volume of the reaction vesse l. Four moles of the 
reactants combine to give two moles of the products. High pressure will  shift the equilibrium 
position to right to give more and more ammonia.
(iii)  Decreasing the temperature will shift it to the forward direc tion according to Le-Chatelier’s 
principle.
 So  high pressure, low temperature and continual removal of amm onia 
will give the maximum yield of ammonia. Table (8.2) shows the efect of the 
rise in temperature on the value of Kc and the Fig. (8.3) shows the optimum 
conditions to get maximum yield of ammonia. Fig (8.3) shows p ercent yield 
of ammonia vs. temperature (0C) at ive diferent operating pressures. 
  At very high pressure and low temperature (top left), the yield of 
NH3 is high but the rate of formation is low. Industrial conditions denoted by 
circle are between 200 and 300 atmospheres at about 4000C.Table (8.2) Effect of temperature on

 No doubt, the yield of NH3 is favoured at low temperature, but the rate of its formation does 
not remain favourable. The rate becomes so slow and the process is rendered uneconomical. One 
needs a compromise to optimize the yield and the rate. The  temperatu re is raised to a moderate 
level and a catalyst is employed to increase the rate. If one wants to achieve the same rate without 
a catalyst, then it requires much higher temperature, which lowers  the yield. Hence the optimum 
conditions are the pressure of 200-300 atm and temperature aroun d 673 K (4000C). The catalyst is 
the pieces of iron crystals embedded in a fused mixture of MgO, A l2O3 and SiO2.
The equilibrium mixture has 35% by volume of ammonia. The mix ture is cooled by refrigeration 
coils until ammonia condenses (B.P = -33.40C) and is removed. Since, boiling points of nitrogen and 
hydrogen are very low, they remain in the gaseous state and are rec ycled by pumps back into the 
reaction chamber.
 Nearly 13% of all nitrogen ixation on earth is accomplished in dustrially through Haber’s 
process. This process synthesizes approximately  110 million tons of ammonia in the world. About 
80% of this is used for the production of fertilizers and some is used in manufacture of explosives 
or the production of nylon and other polymers.

8.2.2  Preparation of Sulphur Trioxide
 In the contact process for manufacture of H2SO4, the conversion of SO2 to SO3 is achieved in 
a reversible reaction.
   22 32SO (g) + O (g)   2SO (g)                       H=-194kJ/mol∆ ฀
 The  temperature and pressure are the most essential factors for c ontrolling the rate of this 
reaction. The principles involved here are the same as those discus sed previously for Haber’s 
process. At low temperature, the equilibrium constant for formation of  SO3 is large but equilibrium 
is reached very slowly. As the temperature is raised the rate i ncreases but the yield of SO3 drops of 
according to Le-Chatelier’s principle. High pressure tends to in crease yield of SO3. However, instead 
of using high pressure, the concentration of O2 (air) is increased to increase the yield of SO3. Table 
(8.3) helps to understand the efect of diferent conditions on the yield of SO3. During the process 
pressure is kept at one atmosphere.

 To have the best possible yield of SO3 within a Table (8.3) Efect of temperature reasonable 
time, a mixture of SO2 and O2 (air) at 1 atm pressure is passed over a solid catalyst at 65 00C. 
The  equilibrium mixture is then recycled at lower temperature, 4 00 to 5000C, to increase the yield 
of SO3. The most efective catalysts are V2O5 and inely divided platinum. SO3 is dissolved in H2SO4 
to get oleum, which is diluted to get H2SO4.
 H2SO4 is the king of chemicals. A country’s industrial progress  is measured by the amount of 
H2SO4 manufactured each year.Temp.

8.3.0 IONIC PRODUCT OF WATER
 Pure water is a very poor conductor of electricity but its conducta nce is measurable. Water 
undergoes self ionization as follows and the reaction is reversible.
    22 3H O + H O  H O  + OH+−฀
or      2H O  H  + OH+−฀
 The equilibrium constant for this reaction can be written as fol lows.
   +-

c
2[H ][OH ]K      =   = 1.8 x 10 moles dmHO
 The concentration of H2O i.e.[H2O] in pure water may be calculated to be 1000gdm3 divided 
by 18gmol -1 giving 55.5 moles dm-3
 Since, water is present in very large excess and very few of its m olecules undergo ionization, 
so its concentration remains efectively constant. Constant concentration of water is taken on L.H.S. 
and multiplied with Kc to get another constant called Kw.
  -16 -14 + -1.8 x 10  x 55.5 = 1.01x10 =[H ][OH ]
  This 1.01x10-14 is called Kw of water of 250C
    +-
c2K [H O]=[H ][OH ]
  So,  + - -14 o
wK   =[H ][OH ]  =10 at 25 C.
 Kw is called  ionic product of water or dissociation constant of wa ter. 
The value of Kw increases almost 75 times when temperature is increased 
from 0°C to 100°C. Anyhow, the increase in K is not regular. T he efect of 
temperature on K. is shown in Table (8.4).Table (8.4) Kw at various 
temperatures.

7.5x10-14278.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 When ever some quantity of acid or base is added in water, then Kw remains the same, but 
[H+] and [OH-]are no more equal. Anyhow, in neutral water
     +-[H ] = [OH ]
  or   + 14[H ][H ] = 10+−
     + 2 14[H ]  = 10−
     + -7 -3[H ] = 10 moles dm
  and   -7 -3[OH ] = 10 moles dm−
 This means that out of 55.5 moles of pure water in one dm3 of it, only 10-7 moles of it have 
dissociated into ions. This shows that water is a very weak electrol yte. At 400C, the [H+] = [OH-] but 
the values are more than 10-7 moles dm-3 and pure water is again neutral at 40°C. Similarly, pure 
water is neutral at 1000C. [H+] and [OH-] are greater than those at 40°C.
 In case of addition of small amount of an acid
    
     +-[H ] > [OH ]
Animation 8.9: IONIC PRODUCT OF WATER
Source & Credit : employees.csbsju288.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
While in the case of addition of few drops of a base
    [OH ] > [H ]−+
During both of these additions, the value of Kw will remain the same i.e. 10-14 at 250C.
pH and pOH
 Actually, in all the aqueous solutions, the concentration of H+ and OH- are too low to 
be conveniently expressed and used in calculations. In 1909, Sor enson, a Danish biochemist, 
introduced the term pH and pOH. So, the scales of pH and pOH ha ve been developed. pH and pOH 
are abbreviations of negative log of hydrogen ion concentration and nega tive log of hydroxide ion 
concentration, respectively.
    +pH = -log[H ]
 and
    pOH = -log[OH ]−
For neutral water, -7pH = -log10   = 7
    -7pOH = -log10   = 7
 when  pH = 7,  solution is neutral
pH < 7,  solution is acidic
pH > 7,  solution is basic→
→
→
 If we take the negative log of Kw, then it is called pKw.
   wwpK = -logK
   14    = -log10−
   wpK = 14log10   Since (log 10=1)
   wpK = 14x1 = 14(at 25C)298.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 The value of pKw is less than 14 at higher tem peratures i.e. at 400Cand 1000C.
 The value  of pH normally varies between 0 → 14 at 25°C. Solutions of negative pH and having 
values more than 14 are also known. Table (8.5) shows the relation ship among [H+],[OH-], pH and 
pOH of various solutions.

8.4.0 IONIZATION CONSTANTS OF ACIDS (Ka)
 Acids and bases when dissolved in water may or may not be com pletely dissociated. Many 
acids are weak electrolytes and they ionize to an extent which is m uch less than 100%. The value of 
Ka called the dissociation constant of acid, is the quantitative measur e of the strength of the acid. 
Suppose we have an acid HA dissolved in water, in a reversible ma nner

Kc for the reversible reaction will be written as follows.
     +-

c
2[H O ][A ]K=[HA][H O]
 At the equilibrium stage, the concentration of water is almost the s ame as at the initial stages 
because it has been taken in large excess. A reasonable approxim ation, therefore, is to take the 
concentration of water to be efectively constant and take it on the left-hand side with Kc.

 Hence   +-

 This  equation can be used to calculate Ka for any acid solution if we know the pH or [H+] of 
that solution and the initial concentration of acid [HA] dissolved. This can also be used to calculate 
the equilibrium concentration of H3O+ and A- produced if we know the initial concentration of acid 
HA and its Ka value.

Percentage of Ionization of Acids
 We can calculate the percentage ionization of weak acid and the for mula is as follows:
    Amount of acid ionized%ionization=  x 100Amount of acid initially available
The  percentage ionization of weak acids depend upon the extent of dil ution of their aqueous 
solutions. Table (8.8) shows the change in percentage ionization of  acetic acid at diferent 
concentrations. Lesser the molarity, diluted the solution, greater the ch ances for electrolyte to be 
dissociated. When 0.1 mole of CH3COOH is dissolved in 1000cm3 of solution, then 1.33 molecules 
are dissociated out of 100, and 13.3 out of 1000. When the 0.00 1 moles are dispersed per dm3 of 
solution then 12.6 molecules of CH3COOH get dissociated out of 100. Remember that Ka remains 
the same at all dilutions at a constant temperature.Table (8.7) Dissociation constants of some acids at  250C and their relative strength338.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab

 Hence, out of 1000 molecules of acetic acid only 13 are dissocia ted into ions, when 0.1 molar 
solution is prepared. In other words when 6 g of CH3COOH i.e 0.1 moles is dissolved in 1000 cm3 of 
solution only 13 molecules ionize out of energy 1000 CH3COOH molecules. 
 This is known as Ostwald’s dilution law, that dilution inc reases the degree of dissociations.
8.5.0 IONIZATION CONSTANT OF BASES (Kb)
 Unlike, strong bases weak Bronsted bases which are proton accep tors, usually consist of 
molecules or ions. They react with water, remove a proton from it, an d generate OH- ions. Take the 
examples of NH3 and CO32-.

NH3 and C032- have  acted as bases in above reactions. They have diferent abilities  to accept protons 
from water molecules. We compare these abilities of bases by knowing  the equilibrium constant Kb, 
which is called base ionization constant of a base.358.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab

 Kb value of a base is the quantitative measurement of strength of a base  Smaller the Kb value, 
weaker the base. Table (8.9) gives the Kb values for some bases.

pKa and pKb
 Table (8.7) and (8.9), we conclude that the values of Ka and Kb for weak acids and bases are 
small numbers usually expressed in exponential form. It is c onvenient to convert them into whole 
numbers by taking their negative log. Thus we obtain pKa and pKb values of acids and bases.368.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
       aapK  = -logK
       bbpK  = -logK
 Larger the pKa, weaker is the acid and vice versa. Similarly, larger the p Kb, weaker is the base. 
If the diference of pKa values of the two acids is one, then acid with smaller pKa is ten times stron -
ger than the other. If the diference is two, then one is hundred times s tronger than the other.
8.6.0 LOWRY BRONSTED ACID AND BASE CONCEPT
 According  to this concept, acids are those species which donate the proton or have a tenden -
cy to donate and bases are those species which accept the proton or h ave a tendency to accept the 
proton.
 Whenever, a weak  acid or a weak base is dissolved in water, th e conjugate acid base pair is 
produced. There is a close relationship between Ka of the acid, Kb of the conjugate base and Kw of 
water. Let us have an acid HA, and it gives protons to water in a reversible manner. H3O+ gives pro -
ton to A- and is an acid, but A- accepts H+ from H3O+ and act as a conjugate base of HA.

 This  equation is useful in the sense that if we know Ka of the acid, we can calculate Kb for 
the conjugate base and vice versa. The value of Kw is a constant at a given temperature. i.e 10-14 at 
25c°
 Let us take the log of above equation

 Since  a abbpK   = -logK  and pK = - logK
 or  a bwpK  + pK = pK

8.7  COMMON ION EFFECT
 The suppression of ionization of a weak electrolyte by adding a common ion from outside is 
called common ion efect. 
 We  are familiar with puriication of sodium chloride by pas sing hydrogen chloride gas through 
saturated brine. Sodium chloride is fully ionized in the solution . Equilibrium constant expression 
for this process can be written as follows:
     +-NaCl(s) Na (aq) + Cl (aq) ฀
     +-
c[Na ][Cl ]K =           [NaCl]398.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
   HCl also ionizes in solution
     +-HCl H (aq) + Cl (aq) ฀
 On passing  HCl gas, concentration of Cl- ions is increased, therefore NaCl crystallizes out of 
the solution to maintain the constant value of the equilibrium constant.
This type of efect is called the common ion efect. The  addition of a common ion to the solution 
of a less soluble electrolyte suppresses its ionization and the con centration of unionized species 
increases, which may come out as a precipitate.
    Na (aq) + Cl (aq) NaCl(s)+−฀
More Examples of Common Ion Effect
(i)  The solubility of a less soluble salts KClO3 in water is suppressed by the addition of a more 
soluble salt KCl by common ion efect. K+ is a common ion. The ionization of KClO3 is suppressed 
and it settles down as precipitate.

(ii)  Similarly, the dissociation of a weak acid H2S in water can be suppressed by the addition of 
stronger acid HCl. H+ is a common ion. H2S becomes less dissociated in acidic solution. In this way 
low concentration of S-2 ion is developed.

(iii)  An addition  of NH4Cl in NH4OH solution suppresses the concentration of OH- (aq) due to the 
presence of a large excess of NH4+ from NH4Cl. Actually, NH4Cl is a strong electrolyte. The combina -

8.8.0 BUFFER SOLUTIONS
 Those solutions, which resist the change in their pH when a small amount of an acid or a base 
is added to them, are called bufer solutions. They have a speciic constant value of pH and their 
pH values do not change on dilution and on keeping for a long time.  Bufer solutions are mostly 
prepared by mixing two substances.418.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
(i)  By mixing a weak acid and a salt of it with a strong base. Such solutions give acidic bufers 
with pH less than 7. Mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate is one of the best examples of such 
a bufer.
(ii)  By mixing a weak base and a salt of it with a strong acid. Such solutions will give basic bufers with pH 
more than 7. Mixture of NH4OH and NH4Cl is one of the best examples of such a basic bufer.
(a)  Why Do We Need Buffer Solution?
 It is a common experience that the pH of the human blood is mai ntained at pH 7.35, if it goes 
to 7.00 or 8.00, a person may die.
 Sometimes  one wants to study a reaction under conditions that would s ufer any associated 
change in the pH of the reaction mixture. So, by suitable choice of the solutes, a chemist can ensure 
that a solution will not experience more than a very small change i n pH, even if a small amount of a 
strong acid or a strong base is added. Bufers are important in many areas of chemistry and allied 
sciences like molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, soi l sciences, nutrition and the clinical 
analysis.

 Bufer is not a new concept at this stage of our discussion, it is  just the application of common 
ion efect.
(b)  How Do the Buffers Act?
 Let us take the example of an acidic bufer consisting of CH3COOH and CH3COONa. Common 
ion efect helps us to understand how the bufer will work. CH3COOH, being a weak electrolyte 
undergoes very little dissociation. When CH3COONa, which is a strong electrolyte, is added to CH -
3COOH solution, then the dissociation of CH3COOH is suppressed, due to common ion efect of 
CH3COO- .

 If one goes on adding CH3COONa in CH3COOH solution, then  the added concentrations of 
CH3COO- decrease the dissociation of CH3COOH and the pH of solution increases. The table (8.10) 
tells us how the pH value of a mixture of two compounds is maintain ed. Greater the concentration 
of acetic acid as compared to CH3COONa, lesser is the pH of solution.

 Actually a bufer mentioned above is a large reservoir of CH3COOH and CH3COO- components. 
When an acid or H3O+ ions are added to this bufer, they will react with CH3COO- to give back acetic 
acid and hence the pH of the solution will almost remain unchang ed. The reason is that CH3COOH 
being a week acid will prefer to remain undissociated. Similar ly, the pufer solution consisting of 
NH4Cl and NH4OH, can resist the change of pH and pOH, when acid or base is added from outside. 
When a base or OH- ions are added in it, they will react with H3O+ to give back H2O and the pH of the 
solution again will remain almost unchanged.Table (8.10) Effect of addition of acetate ions on the pH of acetic acid solution438.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
Calculating the pH of a Buffer
 Let us try to learn, how a bufer of deinite pH can be prepared. C onsider a weak acid HA and 
its salt NaA with a strong base say NaOH. The reversible reaction s for dissociation of HA are as fol -
lows:
      +-HA  H + A ฀
      +-NaA  Na +A ฀
The dissociation constant of a weak acid HA is given by:
     +-
a[H ][A ]K   =[HA]
Rearranging the equation,
     + a
-K [HA][H ]   =[A ]
 The concentration of A in the reaction mixture is predominantly being supplied by NaA which 
is a stro ger electrolyte than HA, and the ionization of HA is being  suppressed by common ion efect 
(A- is the common ion in this bufer solution). Taking log of this eq uation.
    + a
-K [HA]log[H ]   =log[A ]
    +
a -[HA]log[H ]   =log(K ) + log[A ]
 Multiplying with (-1) on both sides
    +
a -[HA]-log[H ]   =-log(K ) - log[A ]
Since -   +
aa -log[H ]   =pH and     -log(K ) =pK
So,    a -[HA]pH   =pK  - log[A ]448.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 [A-] refers to the concentration of the salt. Actually, maximum possibl e concentrate of A- is 
given by NaA, being a strong electrolyte
      a[acid]pH   =pK  - log[salt]
 Interchanging the numerator and denominator the sign of log cha nges
 or      a[salt]pH   =pK  + log[acid]
 This  relationship is called Henderson’s equation. This equa tion shows that two factors evi -
dently govern the pH of a bufer solution. First is the pKa of the acid used and second is the ratio of 
the concentrations of the salt and the acid. The best bufer is prepar ed by taking equal concentra -
tion of salt and acid.
So, pH is controlled by pKa of the acid. For example, for acetic acid sodium acetate bufer, i f
      33[CH COOH] [CH COONa] =
 then     3
a
3[CH COONa]pH   =pK  + log[CH COOH]
      a pH   =pK  + log(1)
 so      aa pH   =pK  + 0 = pK
      pH = 4.74.
 It means that the pH of this bufer is just equal to the pK of the ac id. Similarly for formic acid 
sodium formate bufer, if
     [HCOOH]    =  [HCOONa]
 then     aa pH   =pK  + 0 = pK
 so     pH = 3.78.458.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
 To prepare a bufer of deinite pH, we need a suitable acid for tha t  purpose. We can also 
manage the bufer of our own required pH by suitably selecting the concentration ratio of the salt 
and the acid. If [CH3COOH] is 0.1 mole dm and that of [CH3COONa] is 1.0 mole dm-3 then
     [salt]pH=  4.74 + log  [acid]
     1.0pH=  4.74 + log  0.1 4.74 log10= +
 Since    log10 1 =
     pH = 4.74 + 1 = 5.74
     pH = 5.74
Similarly, if [CH3COOH] is 1.0 mole dm-3 and [CH3COONa] is 0.1 moles dm-3 , then
     0.1pH=  4.74 + log  1
     -1 1pH=  4.74 + log  =4.74+log1010
     pH = 4.74 - 1  =  3.74
 or     pH = 3.74
 Anyhow, the  above mentioned combination can be used to prepare bufers  from 3.74 to 
5.74. The bufer beyond this range will not be good bufers and w ill have small bufer capacities. 
 Just like acidic  bufers, the basic bufer have their own Hender son equation. For this purpose, 
let us use the mixture of NH4OH and NH4Cl. NH4OH is a solution of NH3 in water and it can be rep -
resented as follows:
     +-

      + -1

b
3[NH ][OH ]K =      [NH ]468.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
Taking the log, multiplying with negative sign and rearrangin g, we get
      b[salt]pOH    = pK  + log[base]
 Using this relationship, we  can prepare a basic bufer of the required pOH or pH by suitably 
selecting a base and adj usting the ratio of [salt] / [base].
Example :
 Calculate the pH of a bufer solution in which 0.11 molar CH3COONa and 0.09 molar acetic 
acid solutions are present. Ka for CH3COOH is 1.85 x 10-5
Solution:
 0.11M CH3COONa solution means that 0.11 moles are dissolved in 1 dm3 of solution.
      
      3[CH COONa]    =0.11M
     
      3[CH COOH]    =0.09M
   
      -5
a3K  of CH COOH    =1.85x10
      -5pK = -log(1.8x10 ) = 4.74
      a[salt]pH = pK + log[acid]
    
      a0.11pH = pK + log0.09
      pH = 4.74 + 0.087 = 4.83 Answer
 Since, the concentration of CH3COONa is more than that of CH3COOH, so pH of  bufer is 
greater than 4.74. In other words, the solution has developed the proper ties of a base, because 
CH3COONa has Na+ ion which is from a strong base.478.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
8.8.1 Buffer Capacity
 The bufer capacity of a solution is the capability of a bufer to resist the change of pH. It can 
be measured quantitatively that how much extra acid or base, the sol ution can absorb before the 
bufer is essentially destroyed. Bufer capacity of a bufer solution  is determined by the sizes of 
actual molarities of its components. So,a chemist must decide before m aking the bufer solution, 
what outer limits of change in its pH can be tolerated.
 Let  us do some calculations to check the efectiveness of a bufer system . Consider, that we 
have a bufer having 0.11 molar CH3COONa and 0.09 molar acetic acid. Its pH will be 4.83. L et us 
add 0.01 moles of NaOH in one dm3 of the bufer solution (remember that addition of 0.01 moles 
NaOH per dm3 of solution will change the pH from 7.00 to 12.00 in pure wa ter).
 Since  NaOH is a strong base and it is 100% dissociated, i t generates 0.01 moles OH-. Out of 
0.09 mole of CH3COOH, 0.01 mole will react with OH- and 0.08 moles of CH3COOH is left behind 
in one dm3 of solution. This neutralization of course makes the identical ch ange in the amount of 
CH3COONa and its concentration will increase from 0.11 mole to 0.12  mole.
 Henderson equation is, a[salt]pH = pK + log[acid]
Putting the new concentrations of salt and acid after addition of N aOH.
     0.12pH = 4.74+ log0.08
     pH = 4.74+ log(1.5)
     pH = 4.74+ 0.176
     pH = 4.92  Answer
  It  means that there is a very small change in pH from 4.83 to 4.92, that is only a diference of 
0.1. So we reach the conclusion that a bufer does not hold the pH exa ctly constant. But it does a 
very good job in limiting the change in pH to a very small amount.488.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
8.9.0 EQUILIBRIA OF SLIGHTL Y SOLUBLE IONIC COMPOUND S 
(SOLUBILITY PRODUCT)
 When a soluble ionic compound is dissolved in water, like NaCl,  it dissociates completely 
into ions. But for slightly soluble salts the dissociation is not c omplete at equilibrium stage. For 
example, when PbCl2 is shaken with water the solution contains Pb2+, Cl- and undissociated PbCl2. It 
means that equilibrium exists between solid solute, PbCl2 and the dissolved ions, Pb2+ and Cl-.

8.9.1 Applications of solubility product
(a)  Determination of Ksp, from solubility
 From the solubility of the compounds, we can calculate Ksp of the salt. The solubility for most of 
the compounds are given in terms of the grams of the solute per 100 g of water. Since the quantity 
of solute is very very small, so 100 g of water solution is consid ered to be 100 ml of solution. The 
reason is that the density of water is very close to unity. Hence, we get the concentration in moles 
dm-3. The number of moles of solute dm-3 of the solution is calculated by dividing the mass of solute 
by its molar mass. Then by using the balanced equation, we in d the molarity of each ion and then 
ind Ksp.Table (8.10) Ksp values for some ionic compounds

dm-3 OH- are  present in the solution. In this way, we have calculated the individual concentrations

Effect of Common Ion on Solubility

 Now add Na2CrO4 which is a soluble salt. CrO42- is the common ion. It  combines with Pb2+ to 
form more insoluble PbCrO4. So equilibrium is shifted to the left to keep Ksp constant.548.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
KEY POINTS
1. There versible chemical reactions can achieve a state in which the forward and the reverse 
processes are occurring at the same rate. This state is called sta te of chemical equilibrium. The 
concentrations of reactants and products are called equilibrium c oncentrations and the mixture 
is called equilibrium mixture.
2. Law  of mass action provides the relationship among the concentration s of reactants and products 
of a system at equilibrium stage.The ratio of concentrations of the p roducts to the concentrations 
of reactants is called equilibrium constant. The equilibrium  constants are expressed as Kc, Kp, Kn 
and Kx.
3. The value of equilibrium constant can predict the direction and  extent of a chemical reaction.
4. The efect of change of concentration, temperature, pressure or catalyst i n a reaction can 
be s adied witii the help of Le-Chatelier’s principle. Increasi ng concentrations of reactants or 
decreasing concentrations of products or heating of the endothermic reactions shifts the reaction 
to the forward direction. The change of temperature disturbs the equili brium position and the 
equilibrium constant of reaction. A catalyst decreases the time to rea ch the equilibrium and 
does not alter the equilibrium position and equilibrium constant u nder the given conditions.
5. Water is a very weak electrolyte and ionizes to a slight degree. The ex tent of this a autoionization 
is expressed by ionic product of water called Kw, having a value 10-14 at 250C. The addition of an 
acid or a base changes the [H+] and [OH-], but the ionic product remains the same at 250C.
6. The concentration of H+ is expressed in terms of pH and that of [OH-] in terms of pOH. Neutral 
water has a pH = 7 and pOH= 7.The value of pKw is 14 at 250C.
7. According  to Lowry-Bronsted concept of an acid and a base the c onjugate base of a strong 
acid is always weak. So pKa + pKb = pKw Where pKa and pKb are the parameters to measure the 
strengths of acids and bases.
8. Those solutions which resist the change of pH are called bufer sol utions. Bufer solutions of 
pH below 7 are prepared by mixing a weak acid and salt of it with a strong base while basic 
bufers can be prepared by combining a weak base and salt of it with a strong acid. Hendersen’s 
equation guides us quantitatively to have the bufer solutions of good buf er capacity and to 
select the pair of compounds for this purpose.
9. The  solubility of sparingly soluble substances are calculated  from the solubility product data. This 
data provides us the information about the selective precipitation and f ractional precipitation.
10. Common ion efect operates best in bufer solutions, and puriicati on of certain substances. It 
is one of the best applications of Le-Chatelier’s principle.558.CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM eLearn.Punjab
