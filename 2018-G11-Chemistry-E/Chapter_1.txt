1.1 ATOM
Long time ago, it was thought that matter is made up of simple, ind ivisible particles. Greek 
philosophers thought that, matter could be divided into smaller and  smaller particles to reach 
a basic unit, which could not be further sub-divided. Democritus  (460-370 B.C.) called these 
particles atomos, derived from the word “atomos” means indivisible. H owever, the ideas of Greek 
philosophers were not based on experimental evidences.
In the late 17th century, the quantitative study of the composition of pu re substances disclosed 
that a few elements were the components of many diferent substances. It w as also investigated 
that how, elements combined to form compounds and how compounds cou ld be broken down 
into their constituent elements.
In 1808, an English school teacher, John Dalton, recognized tha t the law of conservation of matter 
and the law of deinite proportions could be explained by the existence of atoms. He developed 
an atomic theory; the main postulate of which is that all matter is composed of atoms of diferent 
elements, which difer in their properties.
Atom is the smallest particle of an element, which can take part in a chemical reaction.  For 
example, He and Ne, etc. have atoms, which have independent existence w hile atoms of hydrogen, 
nitrogen and oxygen do not exist independently.
The modern researches have clearly shown that an atom is further composed of subatomic 
particles like electron, proton, neutron, hypron, neutrino, anti-ne utrino, etc. More than 100 such 
particles are thought to exist in an atom. However, electron, proton and neutron are regarded as 
the fundamental particles of atoms.

A Swedish chemist J. Berzelius- (1779-1848) determined the atomi c masses of elements. A number 
of his values are close to the modern values of atomic masses. Berz elius also developed the system 
of giving element a symbol.
1.1.1   Evidence of Atoms  
It is not possible actually to see the atoms but the nearest possibility  to its direct evidence is by 
using an electron microscope. A clear and accurate image of an object that is smaller than the 
wavelength of visible light, cannot be obtained. Thus an ordinary optical microscope can measure 
the size of an object upto or above 500 nm (lnm = 10-9m). However, objects of the size of an atom 
can be observed in an electron microscope. It uses beams of electrons i nstead of visible light, 
because wavelength of electron is much shorter than that of visible l ight.

Fig. (1.1) shows electron microscopic photograph of a piece of 
a graphite which has been magniied about 15 millions times. 
The bright band in the igure are layers of carbon atoms.
In the 20th century, X-ray work has shown that the diameter of 
atoms are of the order 2x10-10 m which is 0.2 nm. Masses of atoms 
range from 10-27 to 10-25 kg. They are often expressed in atomic 
mass units (amu) when 1 amu is = 1.661 x 10-27 kg. The students 
can have an idea about the amazingly small size of an atom from  
the fact that a full stop may have two million atoms present in it.

1.1.2  Molecule
A molecule is the smallest particle of a pure substance  which can exist independently.  It may 
contain one or more atoms. The number of atoms present in a molecule d etermines its atomicity. 
Thus molecules can be monoatomic, diatomic and triatomic, etc., if  they contain one, two and three 
atoms respectively. Molecules of elements may contain one, two or more same type of atoms. For 
example, He, Cl2, O3, P4, S8. On the other hand, molecules of compounds consist of diferent kind  of 
atoms. For example, HCl, NH3, H2SO4,C6H12O6.
The sizes of molecules are deinitely bigger than atoms. They depend upon the number of atoms 
present in them and their shapes. Some molecules are so big that they  are called macromolecules. 
Haemoglobin is such a macromolecule found in blood. It helps to c arry oxygen from our lungs to 
all parts of our body. Each molecule of haemoglobin is made up of nearly 10,000 atoms and it is 
68,000 times heavier than a hydrogen atom.
1.1.3  Ion
Ions are those species which carry either positive or  negative charge.  Whenever an atom of an 
element loses one or more electrons, positive ions are formed.51.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
A suicient amount of energy is to be provided to a neutral atom to ionize it.
 +-A A  + e→
This A+ is called a cation. A cation may carry +1, +2, +3, etc.ch arge or charges. The number of charges 
present on an ion depends upon the number of electrons lost by the atom . Anyhow, energy is always 
required to do so. Hence the formation of the positive ions is an endotherm ic process. The most 
common positive ions are formed by the metal atoms such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ , Al3+, Fe3+, Sn4+, etc. 
The chapter on chemical bonding will enable us to understand the feasibilities of their formation.
When a neutral atom picks up one or more electrons, a negative ion is produced, which is called an 
anion.
    -B +e B−→
Energy is usually released when an electron is added to the is olated neutral atom, Therefore, the 
formation of an uninegative ion is an exothermic process.The most common negative ions are 
2,Cl , ,F Br S−− − −etc. 
The cations and anions possess altogether diferent properties from their  corresponding neutral 
atoms. There are many examples of negative ions which consist of gr oup of atoms like OH-, CO32-, 
SO42-, PO43-, MnO41-, Cr2O72-  etc. The positive ions having group of atoms are less common e.g. NH4+ 
and some carbocations in organic chemistry.
1.1.4 Molecular Ion
When an atom loses or gains an electron, it forms an ion. Simila rly, a molecule may also lose or 
gain an electron to form a molecular ion, e.g., CH4+, CO+, N2+ 
Cationic molecular ions are more abundant than anionic ones. 
These ions can be generated by passing high energy electron 
beam or α-particles or X-rays through a gas. The break down 
of molecular ions obtained from the natural products can 
give important information about their structure.

1.2 RELATIVE ATOMIC MASS
Relative atomic mass is the mass of an atom of an element as compared to the mass of an 
atom of carbon taken as 12.
The unit used to express the relative atomic mass is called atomic  mass unit (amu) and it is 1/12 
th of the mass of one carbon atom, On carbon -12 scale, the relative atomic mass of 12
6C
            is 12.0000 
amu and the relative atomic mass of 1
1H is 1.008 amu. The masses of the atoms are extremely 
small. We-don’t have any balance to weigh such an extremely small mass, that is why we use the 
relative atomic mass unit scale. 
The relative atomic masses of some elements are given in the following  Table (1.1).

These element have atomic masses in fractions and will be explai ned in the following article on 
isotopes.
1.3 ISOTOPES
In Dalton’s atomic theory, all the atoms of an element were considered a like in all the properties 
including their masses. Later on, it was discovered that atoms of the same element can possess 
diferent masses but same atomic numbers. Such atoms of an element are called isotopes . 
So isotopes are diferent kind of atoms of the same element having same atom ic number, but 
diferent atomic masses. The isotopes of an element possess same chemica l properties and same 
position in the periodic table. This phenomenon of isotopy was irst d iscovered by Soddy. Isotopes 
have same number of protons and electrons but they difer in the number  of neutrons present in 
their nuclei.71.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
Carbon has three isotopes written as 12
6C , 13
6C , 14
6C and expressed as C-12, C-13 and C-14. Each of these 
have 6-protrons and 6 electrons. However, these isotopes have 6, 7 and 8  neutrons respectively. 
Similarly, hydrogen has three isotopes  1
1H, 2
1H ,  3
1H called protium, deuterium and tritium. Oxygen 
has three, nickel has ive, calcium has six, palladium has  six, cadmium has nine and tin has eleven 
isotopes.
1.3.1 Relative Abundance of Isotopes
The isotopes of all the elements have their own natural abundance. Th e properties of a particular 
element, which are mentioned in the literature, mostly correspond to the m ost abundant isotope 
of that element. The relative abundance of the isotopes of elements can b e determined by mass 
spectrometry. Animation 1.5: Basic Concepts

We know at present above 280 diferent isotopes occur in nature. They in clude 40 radioactive 
isotopes as well. Besides these about 300 unstable radioactive isotopes  have been produced 
through artiicial disintegration. The distribution of isotopes among  the elements is varied and 
complex as it is evident from the Table (1.2). The elements like ars enic, luorine, iodine and gold, 
etc have only a single isotope. They are called mono-isotopic elements.
In general, the elements of odd atomic number almost never possess more than two stable isotopes. 
The elements of even atomic number usually have larger number of is otopes and isotopes whose 
mass numbers are multiples of four are particularly abunda nt. For example, l6O, 24Mg, 28Si, 40Ca and 
56Fe form nearly 50% of the earth’s crust. Out of 280 isotopes that oc cur in nature, 154 have even 
mass number and even atomic number.
1.3.2 Determination of Relative Atomic Masses of Is otopes by Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometer is an instrument which is used to m easure the exact masses of diferent 
isotopes of an element.  In this technique, a substance is irst volatilized and then ioni zed with the 
help of high energy beam of electrons. The gaseous positive ions, thus  formed, are separated on 
the basis of their mass to charge ratio (m/e) and then recorded in the form of peaks. Actually mass 
spectrum is the plot of data in such a way that (m/e) is plotted as abscissa (x-axis) and the relative 
number of ions as ordinate (y-axis).12H, H

First of all, Aston’s mass spectrograph was designed to identify  the isotopes of an element 
on the basis of their atomic masses. There is another instrument ca lled Dempster’s mass 
spectrometer. This was designed for the identiication of elements which  were available in 
solid state.
The substance whose analysis for the separation of isotopes is req uired, is converted into the 
vapour state. The pressure of these vapours is kept very low, that is,  10-6 to 10-7 torr. These 
vapours are allowed to enter the ionization chamber where fast moving electrons arc thrown 
upon them. The atoms of isotopic element present in the form of vapours, are ionized. These 
positively charged ions of isotopes of an element have diferent masses dep ending upon the 
nature of the isotopes  present in them.
The positive ion of each isotope has its own (m/e) value. When a potentia l diference (E) of 
500-2000 volts is applied between perforated accelerating plates, then these positive ions are 
strongly attracted towards the negative plate. In this way, the ions a re accelerated.
These ions are then allowed to pass through a strong magnetic ield of  strength (H), which will 
separate them on the basis of their (m/e) values. Actually, the magn etic ield makes the ions 
to move in a circular path. The ions of deinite m/e value will move i n the form of groups one 
after the other and fall on the electrometer.
The mathematical relationship for (m/e) is
2m/e = H r/2E
Where H is the strength of magnetic ield, E is the strength of electric al ield, r is the radius of 
circular path. If E is increased, by keeping H constant then radius will increase and positive ion 
of a particular m/e will fall at a diferent place as compared  to the irst place. This can also be 
done by changing the magnetic ield. Each ion sets up a minute el ectrical current.
Electrometer is also called an ion collector and develops the electrical current. The strength of 
the current thus measured gives the relative abundance of ions of a dei nite m/e value.
Similarly, the ions of other isotopes having diferent masses are mad e to fall on the collector 
and the current strength is measured. The current strength in eac h case gives the relative 
abundance of each of the isotopes. The same experiment is performed with C-12 isotope and 
the current strength is compared. 
This comparison allows us to measure the exact mass number of th e isotope Fig. (1.2), shows 
the separation of isotopes of Ne. Smaller the (m/e) of an isotope, sma ller the radius of curvature 
produced by the magnetic ield according to above equation.101.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
In modern spectrographs, each ion strikes a detector, the ionic curr ent is ampliied and is fed to the 
recorder. The recorder makes a graph showing the relative abunda nce of isotopes plotted against 
the mass number.
The above Fig (1.3) shows a computer plotted graph for the isotopes of  neon.
The separation of isotopes can be done by the methods based on their p roperties. Some important 
methods are as gaseous difusion, thermal difusion, distillation,  ultracentrifuge, electromagnetic 
separation and laser separation.
1.3.3 Average Atomic Masses
Table (1.1) of atomic masses of elements shows many examples of  fractional values. Actually 
the atomic masses depend upon the number of possible isotopes and their natural abundance. 
Following solved example will throw light on this aspect.
Example (1):
A sample of neon is found to consist of 20
10Ne, 21
10Ne and 22
10Ne in the percentages of 90.92%, 0.26%, 
8.82% respectively. Calculate the fractional atomic mass of neon.
Solution:
The overall atomic mass of neon, which is an ordinary isotopic m ixture, is the average of the de-
termined atomic masses of individual isotopes. Hence
Average atomic mass =   20x90.92 21x0.26 22x8.8220.18100Answer++=
Fig (1.3) Computer plotted graph 
for the isotopes of neon
 Fig(1.2) Diagram of a simple Mass 
Spectrometer111.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
Hence the average atomic mass of neon is 20.18 amu
It is important to realize that no individual neon atom in the sample has a mass of 20.18 amu. For 
most laboratory purposes, however, we consider the sample to consist of atoms with this average 
mass.
1.4 ANAL YSIS OF A COMPOUND - EMPIRICAL AND MOLECULA R 
FORMULAS
Before we go into the details of empirical and molecular formulas of  a compound, we should be 
interested to know the percentage of each element in the compound. For this purpose all the 
elements present in the compound are irst identiied. 
This is called qualitative analysis. After that the compound is subjected to quantitative analysis 
in which the mass of each element in a sample of the compound i s determined. From this we 
determine the percentage by mass of each element. The percentage of an el ement in a compound 
is the number of grams of that element present in 100 grams of the c ompound.
Example (2):
8.657 g of a compound were decomposed into its elements and gave 5. 217 g of carbon, 0.962 g of 
hydrogen, 2.478 g of oxygen. Calculate the percentage composition  of the compound under study.

The above results tell us that in one hundred grams of the given comp ound, there are 60.26 grams 
of carbon, 11.11 grams of hydrogen and 28.62 grams of oxy gen.
Percentage composition of a compound can also be determined theoreticall y if we know the formula 
mass of the compound. The following equation can be used for this purpose.

1.4.1 Empirical Formula
It is the simplest formula that gives the small whole number ratio b etween the atoms of diferent 
elements present in a compound. In an empirical formula of a com pound, AxBy, there are x atoms 
of an element A and y atoms of an element B. 
The empirical formula of glucose (C6H12O6) is CH2O and that of benzene (C6H6) is CH.
Empirical formula of a compound can be calculated following the steps mentioned below:
1. Determination of the percentage composition.
2. Finding the number of gram atoms of each element. For this purpose  divide the mass of each 
element (% of an element) by its atomic mass.
3. Determination of the atomic ratio of each element. To get this, divide the num ber of moles of 
each element (gram atoms) by the smallest number of moles.
4. If the atomic ratio is simple whole number, it gives the empirical formula, otherwise multiply 
with a suitable digit to get the whole number atomic ratio.
Example (3):
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) contains 40.92% carbon, 4.58% h ydrogen and 54.5% of oxygen by mass. 
What is the empirical formula of the ascorbic acid?
Solution:
From the percentages of these elements, we believe that in 100 grams of  ascorbic acid, there are 
40.92 grams of carbon, 4.58 grams of hydrogen and 54.5 g rams of oxygen.131.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
Divide these masses of the elements (or percentages) by their atomic masses  to get the number of 
gram atoms.
 
    14.58gNo. of gram atoms of hydrogen =  =  4.54  gram atoms1.008 gmol−
    154.5gNo. of gram atoms of oxygen =  =  3.406 gram atoms16 gmol−
Atomic ratio is obtained by dividing the gram atoms with 3.406,  which is the smallest number.
      
 
   
To convert them into whole numbers, multiply with three
     C:H:O = 3(1 : 1.33 : 1) = 3 : 4 : 3 Answ er
This  whole number ratio gives us the subscripts for the empiri cal formula of the ascorbic acid 
i.e.,C3H4O3.
1.4.2 Empirical Formula from Combustion Analysis
Those organic compounds which simply consist of carbon, hydr ogen and oxygen can be analyzed 
by combustion. The sole products will be CO2 and H2O. These two products of combustion are 
separately collected.3.41 4.54 3.406C:H:O =  :  : 3.406 3.406 3.406140.92gNo. of gram atoms of carbon =  =   3.41 gram atoms12.0 gmol−

Combustion Analysis
A weighed sample of the organic compound is placed in the combu stion tube. This combustion tube 
is itted in a furnance. Oxygen is supplied to burn the compound . Hydrogen is converted to H2O 
and carbon is converted to CO2. These gases are absorbed in Mg (ClO4)2 and 50% KOH respectively. 
(Fig 1.4). The diference in the masses of these absorbers gives us  the amounts of H2O and CO2 
produced. The amount of oxygen is determined by the method of diference.
Following formulas are used to get the percentages of carbon, hydrogen  and oxygen, respectively.
The percentage of oxygen is obtained by the method of diference.
% of oxygen = 100 - (% of carbon + % of hydrogen) .
Example (4):
A sample of liquid consisting of carbon, , hydrogen and  oxy gen was subjected to combustion 
analysis. 0.5439 g of the compound gave 1.039 g of CO2, 0.6369. g of H2O.
Determine the empirical formula of the compound.
Solution:
Mass of organic Compound  = 0.5439 g
Mass of carbon dioxide   = 1.039g
Mass of water     = 0.6369 g

1.4.3 Molecular Formula
That formula of a substance which is based on the actual molec ule is called molecular formula. It 
gives the total number of atoms of diferent elements present in the molecule of  a compound. For 
example, molecular formula of benzene is C6H6 while that of glucose is C6H12O6.
The empirical formulas of benzene and glucose are CH and CH2O respectively, so for these 
compounds the molecular formulas are the simple multiple of empir ical formulas. Hence
Molecular formula = n (Empirical formula)
Where ‘n’ is a simple integer. Those compounds whose empirical  and molecular formulae are the 
same are numerous. For example, H2O, CO2, NH3 and C12H22O11 have same empirical and molecular 
formulas. Their simple multiple ‘n’ is unity. Actually the  value of ‘n’ is the ratio of molecular mass 
and empirical formula mass of a substance.

There are many possible structures for this molecular formula.
1.5 CONCEPT OF MOLE
We know that atom is an extremely small particle. The mass of an individual atom is extremely 
small quantity. It is not possible to weigh individual atoms or even  small number of atoms directly. 
That is why, we use the atomic mass unit (amu) to express the atom ic masses.
For the sake of convenience, the atomic mass may be given in any unit of measurement i.e. grams, 
kg, pounds, and so on.
When the substance at our disposal is an element then the atomic mass  of that element expressed 
in grams is called one gram atom. It is also called one gram  mole or simply a mole of that element.
Mass of an element in gramsNumber of gram atoms or moles of an elem ent =  Molar mass of an element 
For example
1 gram atom of hydrogen   = 1.008 g 
1 gram atom of carbon  = 12.000 g
and         1 gram atom of uranium         = 238.0 g
It  means that one gram atom of diferent elements have diferent masses in  them. One mole of 
carbon is 12 g, while 1 mole of magnesium is 24g. It also s hows that one atom of magnesium is 
twice as heavy as an atom of carbon.
The  molecular mass of a substance expressed in grams is cal led gram molecule or gram mole or 
simply the mole of a substance.181.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab

1 gram molecule of H2SO4  = 98.0 g
and   1 gram molecule of sucrose  = 342.0 g
It means that one gram molecules of diferent molecular substances ha ve diferent masses.
The formula unit mass of an ionic compound expressed i n grams is called gram formula of 
the substance.  Since ionic compounds do not exist in molecular form therefore the su m of atomic 
masses of individual ions gives the formula mass. The gram f ormula is also referred to as gram 
mole or simply a mole.
Mass of the ionic substance in gramsNumber of gram formulas or moles of a su bstance =  Formula mass of the ionic substance
1 gram formula of NaCl          = 58.50 g 
1 gram formula of Na2CO3     = 106 g 
1gram formula of AgNO3       = 170g
It may also be mentioned here that ionic mass of an ionic spec ies expressed in grams is called one gram ion or 
one mole of ions.
For example
1 g ion of OH- = 17g 
1 g ion of SO42-=96g 
1 g ion of CO32- =60g
So, the atomic mass, molecular mass, formula mass or ionic mass  of the substance expressed 
in gram is called molar mass of the substance.Mass of the ionic species in gramsNumber of gram ions or moles of an speci es =  Formula mass of the ionic species191.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab

1.5.1 Avogadro's Number
Avogadro's number is the number of atoms, molecules and ions in on e gram atom of an element, 
one gram molecule of a compound and one gram ion of a substance,  respectively.
To understand Avogadro's number let us consider the following quan tities of substances.
1.008 g of hydrogen  = 1 mole of hydrogen  = 6.02 x 1023 atoms of H
23 g of sodium             = 1 mole of Na            = 6 .02 x1O23 atoms of Na
238 g of uranium                      = 1 mole of U             = 6.02 x 1023 atoms of U
This number, 6.02 x 1023 is the number of atoms in one mole of the element. It is interesting  to know that 
diferent masses of elements have the same number of atoms. An atom of sodium is 23 times heavier than an 
atom of hydrogen. In order to have equal number of atoms sodium sh ould be taken 23 times greater in mass 
than hydrogen. Magnesium atom is twice heavier than carbon; i.e.  10g of Mg and 5 g of C contain the same 
number of atoms.
18 g of H2O             =1 mole of water  =6.02 x 1023 molecules of water
180 g of glucose  = 1 mole of glucose = 6.02 x 1023 molecules of glucose
342 g of sucrose  = 1 mole of sucrose = 6.02 x 1023 molecules of sucrose
Hence, one mole of diferent compounds has diferent masses but has the same number of 
molecules.
 When we take into consideration the ions, then
  96 g of SO42- = 1 mole of SO42- = 6.02 x 1023 ions of SO42-
  62 g of NO3-  = 1 mole of NO3- = 6.02 x 1023 ions of NO3-211.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
From the above discussion, we reach the conclusion that the number 6. 02 X 1023 is equal to one 
mole of a substance. This number is called Avogadro’s number a nd it is denoted by NA.
Following relationships between amounts of substances in terms of thei r masses and the number 
of particles present in them, are useful
A Mass of the element x N1)     Number of atoms of an element =  Atomic mass
A Mass of the compound x N2)     Number of molecules of a compound  =  Molecular mass
When we have compounds of known mass we can calculate the number  of atoms from their 
formulas. In 18 g of water there are present 6.02 x 1023 molecules of H2O, 2 x 6.02 x 1023 atoms of 
hydrogen and 6.02 x 1023 atoms of oxygen. Similarly, in 98g of H2SO4, it has twice the Avogadro’s 
number of hydrogen atoms, four times the Avogadro’s number of oxygen atoms and the Avogadro’s 
number of sulphur atoms.
Some substances ionize in suitable solvents to yield cations and an ions. The  number of such ions, 
their masses, number of positive and negative charges can be easi ly calculated from the known 
amount of the substance dissolved. Let us dissolve 9.8 g of H2SO4 in suicient quantity of H2O to 
get it completely ionized. It has 0.1 moles of H2SO4. It will yield 0.2 mole or 0.2 x 6.02 x 1023 H+ and 
0.1 moles or 0.1 x 6.02 x 1023 SO42- etc. Total positive charges will be 0.2 x 6.02 x 1023 and the total 
negative charges will be 0.2 x 6.02 x 1023 (because each SO42-, has two negative charges). The total 
mass of H+ is (0.2 x 1.008)g and that of SO42- is (0.1 x 96) g.
Example (8):
How many molecules of water are there in 10.0 g of ice? Also cal culate the number of atoms of 
hydrogen and oxygen separately, the total number of atoms and the cova lent bonds present in the

1.5.2 Molar Volume
One mole of any gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) occupies a volume of 22.414 dm3. 
This volume of 22.414 dm3 is called molar volume and it is true only when the gas is idea l (the idea 
of the ideality of the gas is mentioned in chapter three).
With the help of this information, we can convert the mass of a gas at STP into its volume and vice 
versa.
Hence we can say that
2.016 g of H2 = 1 mole of H2 = 6.02 x 1023 molecules of H2 = 22.414 dm3 of H2 at S.T.P 
16g of CH4 = 1 mole of CH4 = 6.02 x 1023 molecules of CH4= 22.414 dm3 of CH4 at S.T.P.
It is very interesting to know from the above data that 22.414 dm3 of each gas has a diferent mass 
but the same number of molecules. The reason is that the masses and the sizes of the molecules 
don't afect the volumes. Normally, it is known that in the gaseous sta te the distance between 
molecules is 300 times greater than their diameters.
Example (10):
A well known ideal gas is enclosed in a container having volume 500 cm3 at S.T.P. Its mass comes 
out to be 0.72g.What is the molar mass of this gas.

1.6 STOICHIOMETRY
With the knowledge of atomic mass, molecular mass, the mole, the Avog adro’s number and the 
molar volume, we can make use of the chemical equations in a much  better way and can get many 
useful information from them.
Chemical equations have certain limitations as well. They do not tel l about the conditions and the 
rate of reaction. Chemical equation can even be written to describe a c hemical change that does 
not occur. So, when stoichiometeric calculations are performed, we ha ve to assume the following 
conditions.
1. All the reactants are completely converted into the products.
2. No side reaction occurs.
Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry which tells us  the quantitative relationship between 
reactants and products in a balanced chemical equation.
While doing calculations, the law of conservation of mass and the law of deinite proportions are 
obeyed.
The following type of relationships can be studied with the help of  a balanced chemical equation.
1) Mass-mass Relationship
If we are given the mass of one substance, we can calculate the m ass of the other substances 
involved in the chemical reaction.
2) Mass-mole Relationship or Mole-mass Relationship
If we are given the mass of one substance, we can calculate the moles of other substance and vice-
versa.
3) Mass-volume Relationship
If we are given the mass of one substance, we can calculate the vol ume of the other substances and 
vice-versa.Similarly, mole-mole calculations can also be performed .261.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
Example (11):
Calculate the number of grams of K2SO4 and water produced when 14 g of KOH are reacted with 
excess of H2SO4. Also calculate the number of molecules of water produced.
Solution:
For doing such calculations, irst of all convert the given mass of  KOH into moles and then compare 
these moles with those of K2SO4 with the help of the balanced chemical equation.
Equation:               2KOH(aq) + H2SO4(aq)   K2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l)
To get the number of moles of K2SO4, compare the moles of KOH with those of K2SO4.
   
So, 0.125 moles of K2SO4 is being produced from 0.25 moles of KOH 
Molar mass of K2SO4 = 2 x 39 + 96

So, the number of moles of water produced is 0.25 from 0.25 moles of KOH

1.7 LIMITING REACTANT
Having completely understood the theory of stoichiometry of the chemical  reactions, we shift 
towards the real stoichiometric calculations. Real in the sense tha t we deal with such calculations 
very commonly in chemistry. Often, in experimental work, one or m ore reactants is/are deliberately 
used in excess quantity. The quantity exceeds the amount required b y the reaction’s stoichiometry. 
This is done, to ensure that all of the other expensive reactant is com pletely used up in the chemical 
reaction. Sometimes, this strategy is employed to make reactions occur f aster. For example, we 
know that a large quantity of oxygen in a chemical reaction makes  things burn more rapidly. In 
this way excess of oxygen is left behind at the end of reaction an d the other reactant is consumed 
earlier. This reactant which is consumed earlier is called a  limiting reactant. In this way, the amount 
of product that forms is limited by the reactant that is completely  used. Once this reactant is 
consumed, the reaction stops and no additional product is formed. Hence the limiting reactant 
is a reactant that controls the amount of the product fo rmed in a chemical reaction due to 
its smaller amount.
The concept of limiting reactant is analogous to the relationship b etween the number of “kababs” 
and the “slices” to prepare “sandwiches”. If we have 30 “kabab s” and ive breads “having 58 slices”, 
then we can only prepare 29 “sandwiches”. One “kabab” will  be extra (excess reactant) and “slices” 
will be the limiting reactant. It is a practical problem that w e can not purchase exactly sixty “slices” 
for 30 “kababs” to prepare 30 “sandwiches”.31001 g is present in HCl solution =  27

Consider the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water.
2H2(g) + O2(g)   2H2O(l)
When  we take 2 moles of hydrogen (4g) and allow it to react with  2 moles of oxygen (64g), then we 
will get only 2 moles (36 g) of water. Actually, we will get 2 moles (36g) of water because 2 moles 
(4g) of hydrogen react with 1 mole (32 g) of oxygen according to the balanced equation. Since less 
hydrogen is present as compared to oxygen, so hydrogen is a lim iting reactant. If we would have 
reacted 4 moles (8g) of hydrogen with 2 moles (64 g) of oxygen, w e would have obtained 4 moles 
(72 g) of water.
Identiication of Limiting Reactant
To identify a limiting reactant, the following three steps are perfor med.
1. Calculate the number of moles from the given amount of reactant.
2. Find out the number of moles of product with the help of a balan ced chemical equation.
3. Identify the reactant which produces the least amount of product as limiting reactant.
Following numerical problem will make the idea clear.
Example (13):
NH3 gas can be prepared by heating together two solids NH4Cl and Ca(OH)2. If a mixture containing 
100 g of each solid is heated then
(a) Calculate the number of grams of NH3 produced.
(b) Calculate the excess amount of reagent left unreacted.

Solution:
(a) Convert the given amounts of both reactants into their number of moles.
  
Compare the number of moles of NH4Cl with those of NH3
NH4Cl  : NH3

Similarly compare the number of moles of Ca(OH)2 with those of NH3.
Ca(OH)2 : NH3
1  : 2
1.35  : 2.70
Since the number of moles of NH3 produced by l00g or 1.87 moles of NH4Cl are less, so NH4Cl is the 
limiting reactant. The other reactant, Ca(OH)2 is present in excess. Hence 
Mass of NH3 produced = 1.87 moles x 17 g mol-1
     = 31.79 g Answer
(b) Amount of the reagent present in excess
Let  us calculate the number of moles of Ca(OH)2 which will completely react with 1.87 moles of 
NH4Cl with the help of equation. For this purpose, compare NH4Cl and Ca(OH)2

Hence the number of moles of Ca(OH)2 which completely react with 1.87 moles of NH4Cl is 0.935 
moles.
No. of moles of Ca(OH)2 taken =1.35
No. of moles of Ca(OH)2 used = 0.935
No. of moles of Ca(OH)2 left behind = 1.35 - 0.935 = 0.415
Mass of Ca(OH)2 left unreacted (excess) = 0.415x74 = 30.71 g  Answer 
It means that we should have mixed 100 g of NH4Cl with 69.3 g (100 - 30.71) of Ca(OH)2 to get 1.87 
moles of NH3.
1.8 YIELD
The amount of the products obtained in a chemical reaction is ca lled the actual yield of that reaction.
The amount of the products calculated from the balanced chemical equation represents the 
theoretical yield. The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of th e product that can be produced 
by a given amount of a reactant, according to balanced chemical equation.
In most chemical reactions the amount of the product obtained is less than the theoretical yield. 
There are various reasons for that. A practically inexperienced worker has many shortcomings and 
cannot get the expected yield. The processes like iltration, separation b y distillation, separation 
by a separating funnel, washing, drying and crystalliza tion if not properly carried out, decrease 
the actual yield. Some of the reactants might take part in a competi ng side reaction and reduce 
the amount of the desired product. So in most of the reactions the actua l yield is less than the 
theoretical yield.
A chemist is usually interested in the eiciency of a reaction. The eiciency of a reaction is expressed 
by comparing the actual and theoretical yields in the form of perc entage (%) yield.
Actual yield% yield =  x 100 Theoretical yield321.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
Example (14):
When lime stone (CaCO3) is roasted, quicklime (CaO) is produced according to the fol lowing equation. 
The actual yield of CaO is 2.5 kg, when 4.5 kg of lime stone is roasted. What is the percentage yield 
of this reaction.
Solution:
Mass of limestone roasted    = 4.5 kg = 4500 g
Mass of quick lime produced (actual yield) = 2.5 kg = 25 00 g
Molar mass of CaCO3     = 100 g mol-1
Molar mass of CaO     = 56 g mol-1
According to the balanced chemical equation
100 g of CaCO3 should give CaO   = 56 g
1g of CaCO3 should give CaO   = 56 / 100
4500 g of CaCO3 should give CaO   = 56 / 100 x 4500
                = 2520 g
Theoretical yield of CaO    = 2520 g
Actual yield of CaO     = 2500 g
Actual yield 2500% yield =  x 100 =  x 100Theoretical yield 2520

KEY POINTS
1. Atoms  are the building blocks of matter. Atoms can combine to form  molecules. Covalent com -
pounds mostly exist in the form of molecules. Atoms and molecules c an either gain or lose elec -
trons, forming charged particles called ions. Metals tend to lose el ectrons, becoming positively 
charged ions. Non-metals tend to gain electrons forming negatively ch arged ions. When X-rays 
or α -particles are passed through molecules in a gaseous state, th ey are converted into molec -
ular ions.
2. The  atomic mass of an element is determined with reference to the mas s of carbon as a standard 
element and is expressed in amu. The fractional atomic masses c an be calculated from the 
relative abundance of isotopes. The separation and identiication of is otopes can be carried out 
by mass spectrograph.
3. The  composition of a substance is given by its chemical formula . A molecular substance can be 
represented by its empirical or a molecular formula. The empir ical and molecular formula are 
related through a simple integer.
4. Combustion analysis is one of  the techniques to determine the empir ical formula and then the 
molecular formula of a substance by knowing its molar mass.
5. A mole of any substance is the  Avogadro’s number of atoms or molecu les or formula units of 
that substance.
6. The  study of quantitative relationship between the reactants and the products in a balanced 
chemical equation is known as stoichiometry. The mole concept can b e used to calculate the 
relative quantities of reactants and products in a balanced chemic al equation. 
7. The  concept of molar volume of gases helps to relate solids and l iquids with gases in a quantitative 
manner.
8. A limiting reactant is  completely consumed in a reaction and controls the quantity of products 
formed.
9. The  theoretical yield of a reaction is the quantity of the products calculated with the help of a 
balanced chemical equation. The actual yield of a reaction is  always less than the theoretical 
yield. The eiciency of a chemical reaction can be checked by ca lculating its percentage yield.341.BASIC CONCEPTS eLearn.Punjab
