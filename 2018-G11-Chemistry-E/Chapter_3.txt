3.1  STATES OF MATTER
Matter exists in four states i.e., solid, liquid, gas and plas ma. The simplest form of matter is the 
gaseous state and most of matter around us is in the solid state.
Liquids are less common than solids, gases and plasmas. T he reason is that the liquid state of any 
substance can exist only within a relatively narrow range of temp erature and pressure.
Let us look at the general properties of gases, liquids and solids . Kinetic molecular theory of gases 
can help us understand their properties.

3.1.1  Properties of Gases
1. Gases don’t have a deinite volume and occupy all the available space.  The volume of a gas is the 
volume of the container.
2. They don’t have a deinite shape and take the shape of the container jus t like liquids.
3. Due to low densities of gases, as compared to those of liquids and s olids, the gases bubble 
through liquids and tend to rise up.
4. Gases can difuse and efuse. This property is negligible in sol ids but operates in liquids as well.
5. Gases can be compressed by applying a pressure because there ar e large empty spaces between 
their molecules.
6. Gases can expand on heating or by increasing the availabl e volume. Liquids and solids, on the 
other hand, do not show an appreciable increase in volume when they  are heated.
7. When sudden expansion of gases occurs cooling takes place, i t is called Joule Thomson efect.
8. Molecules of gases are in a constant state of random motion They can exert a certain pressure 
on the walls of the container and this pressure is due to the number  of collisions.
9. The intermolecular forces in gases are very weak.
3.1.2  Properties of Liquids
6. Liquids don’t have a deinite shape but have a deinite volume. Unlike s olids they adopt the 
shape of the container.
7. Molecules of liquids are in a constant state of motion. The evaporation and difusion of liquid 
molecules is due to this motion.
8. The densities of liquids are much greater than those of gases but are close to those of solids.
9. The spaces among the molecules of liquids are negligible just li ke solids.
10. The intermolecular attractive forces in liquids are intermediate between  gases and solids. The 
melting and boiling points of gases, liquids and solids depen d upon the strength of such forces.
11. Molecules o f liquids possess kinetic energy due to their motion. Li quids can be converted 
into solids on cooling i.e., by decreasing their kinetic energ y. Molecules of liquids collide among 
themselves and exchange energy but those of solids can not do so.43.GASES eLearn.Punjab
3.1.3  Properties of Solids
1. The particles present in solid substances are very close to each other  and they are tightly packed. 
Due to this reason solids are non-compressible and they cannot difus e into each other.
2. There are strong attractive forces in solids which hold the particles  together irmly and for this 
reason solids have deinite shape and volume.
3. The solid particles possess only vibrational motion.
3.1.4  Units of Pressure:  
The pressure of air that can support 760 mmHg column at sea l evel, is called one atmosphere. It 
is the force exerted by 760mm or 76cm long column of mercury on a n area of 1cm2 at 0°C.It is the 
average pressure of atmosphere at sea level 1mmHg=1torr. The S.I. uni t of pressure is expressed 
in -2Nm. One atmospheric pressure i.e 760 torr is equal to 101325  -2Nm.
1pascal=1  -2Nm. So, 760 torr = 101325Pa = 101.325 kilopascals (kpa is  another unit of pressure)
The unit pounds per square inch (psi) is used most commonly i n engineering work, and 1 atm = 760 
torr=14.7 pounds -2inch . The unit millibar is commonly used by meteorologists.
3.2 GAS LAWS
It is a matter of common observation that when external conditions of temp erature and pressure 
are changed, the volume of a given quantity of all gases is afected.  This efect is nearly the same 
irrespective of the nature of the gas. So gases show a uniform beha viour towards the external 
conditions. The gas laws describe this uniform behaviour of ga ses. The relationships between 
volume of a given amount of gas and the prevailing conditions of temp erature and pressure are 
called the gas laws. Diferent scientists, like Boyle, Charles, Gra ham and Dalton have given their 
laws relating to the properties of gases.53.GASES eLearn.Punjab
3.2.1 Boyle’s Law
In Boyle’s law the pressure and volume are variables while the temper ature and quantity of a gas 
remains constant. Boyle’s law is stated as follows:-
The volume of a given mass of a gas at constant temperatur e is inversely proportional to the 
pressure applied to the gas.
So 
Va1/P (when the temperature and number of moles are constant)
 or V=k/p
 PV = k (when T and n are constant)   (1)
‘k’ is proportionality constant. The value of k is diferent for the d iferent amounts of the same gas.
According to the equation (1), Boyle’s law can also be deined as The product of pressure and 
volume of a ixed amount of a gas at constant temperature i s a constant quantity.  
So P1V1 = k and P2V2 = k
Hence P1V1 = P2V2
Animation 3.3: Boyle’s Law

P1V1 are the initial values of pressure and volume, while P2V2 are the inal values of pressure and 
volume.
3.2.2  Experimental Veriication of Boyle’s Law
The following diagram Fig. (3.1) indicates that at constant temp erature say at 250C,the volume of a 
given quantity of a gas is reduced in proportion to the increase in pressure. Let us take a gas in a 
cylinder having a moveable piston. 
The cylinder is also attached with a manometer to read the pressure of  the gas directly. Let the 
initial volume of gas is 1 dm3 and its pressure is 2 atmospheres when the piston has one weigh t on 
it. When the piston is pressed twice with the help of two equal weig hts, the pressure becomes four 
atmospheres.
Similarly, when the piston is loaded with a mass three times grea ter, then the pressure becomes 
six atmospheres. The initial volume of the gas at two atmospheres i s 1 dm3 it is reduced to 1/2 dm3 
and then 1/3 dm3 with increase of weights, respectively Fig (3.1).
 P1V1 = 2 atm x 1 dm3 = 2 dm3 atm = k
P2V 2 = 4 atm x 1/2 dm3 = 2 dm3 atm = k
P 3V 3 =  6 atm x  1/3 dm3 = 2 dm3 atm = k
Hence Boyle’s law is veriied.
The value of k will remain the same for the same quantity of a ga s at the same temperature.Fig (3.1) Veriication of Boyle’s Law73.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Example 1
A gas having a volume of 10 dm3 is enclosed in a vessel at 00C and the pressure is 2.5 atmospheres. 
This gas is allowed to expand until the new pressure is 2 atm ospheres. What will be the new volume 
of this gas, if the temperature is maintained at 273 K.
Solution
Initial volume of gas (V1)
Initial temperature (T1)
Initial pressure (P1)
Final pressure (P2)
Final temperature (T2)
Final volume (V2)= 10 dm3
= 00C + 273 K = 273 K
= 2.5 atm
= 2 atm
= 273 K
= ?
Since the temperature is constant ( T1= T2) Boyle’s law is applicable
P1V1= P2V2 (when T and n are constant)
V2  = P1V1
          P2
V2  =2.5 atm x 10 dm3
               2 atm
= 12.5 dm3 Answer
3.2.3 Graphical Explanation of Boyle’s Law
Let us take a particular amount of a gas at a constant temperature 
say 00C and enclose it in a cylinder having a piston in it. When 
the pressure of the gas is varied, its volume changes. Increase 
in pressure decreases the volume. If a graph is plotted between 
pressure on the x-axis (abscissa) and volume on the y-axis 
(ordinate), then a curve is obtained as shown in the Fig (3.2 ). This 
curve is called isotherm ‘iso’ means same, “therm” means heat. 
Now increase the temperature of the gas to 25°C.
Fig (3.2) Isotherm of a gas at 0 0C.83.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Keep this temperature constant and again vary the pressure and 
volume, and plot the isotherm. It goes away from both the axes 
Fig (3.3). The reason is that at higher temperature, the volume of 
the gas has increased. Similarly, if we increase the tempe rature 
further, make it constant and plot another isotherm, it further 
goes away from the axis.
If a graph is plotted between  1/V on x-axis and the pressure P  on 
the y-axis then a straight line is obtained as shown in the Fig 
(3.4). This shows that the pressure and inverse of volume  are 
directly proportional to each other. This straight line will  meet 
at the origin which means that when the pressure is very close to 
zero, then the volume is  so high that its inverse is very close to 
zero.
By increasing the temperature of the same gas from T1 to T2 and 
keeping it constant, one can vary pressure and volume. The graph 
of this data between P and 1/V  will give another straight line. This 
straight line at T2 will be closer to the pressure-axis Fig (3.4).
Now, plot a graph between pressure on x-axis and the product PV  on 
Y-axis. A straight line parallel to the pressure axis is obta ined  Fig(3.5). 
This straight line indicates that 'k' is a constant quantity. 
At higher constant temperature, the volume increase and value 
of product PV should increase due to increase of volume at same 
pressure, but PV remains constant at this new temperature and a 
straight line parallel to the pressure axis is obtained. This type of 
straight line will help us to understand the non-ideal behaviour  
of gases. Boyle's law is applicable only to ideal gases.

3.2.4 Charle s 's Law
It is a quantitative relationship between 
temperature and volume of a gas and was given 
by French scientist J. 
Charles in 1787. According to this law, the 
volume of the given mass of a gas is directly 
proportional to the absolute temperature 
when the pressure is kept constant.
V a T (when pressure 
and number of moles 
are constant)
V = kT
V/T=k
If the temperature is changed from T1 to T2 and 
volume changes from V1 to V2  , then
V1/T1=k and V2/T2=k
So,    V1/T1= V2/T2               ................................. (2)
The ratio of volume to temperature remains constant for same amount of ga s at same pressure.
3.2.5 Experimental Veriication of Charles ‘s Law
Let us consider a certain amount of a gas enclosed in a cylinder  itted with a movable piston. The 
volume of the gas is V1 and its temperature is T1. When the gas in the cylinder is  heated both 
volume and the temperature of the gas increase. Animation 3.4: Charle s 's Law
Source & Credit: docsity103.GASES eLearn.Punjab
The new values of volume and temperature are V2  and 
T2  respectively Fig(3.6). Experiment shows that
V1/T1= V2/T2 
Hence Charles’s law is veriied.
Example 2
250 cm3 of hydrogen is cooled from 127oC to -27°C by 
maintaining the pressure constant Calculate the new 
volume of the gas at low temperature.
Solution
Pressure has been kept constant so this gas is obeying the Charl es’s law.
Initial volume (V1) = 250 cm3 = 0.25 dm3
Initial temperature (T1) = 127 °C + 273 K = 400 K
Final temperature (T2) = -27 °C + 273K - 246 K
Final volume (V2) = ?
According to Charles’s law
V1/T1= V2/T2  (when pressure and number of moles are constant)
V2 = V1x T2
                    T1
V2 = 0.25 dm3 x 246K    = 0.153 dm3 = 153 cm3 Answer
               400 K
So by decreasing the temperature the volume of the gas has decreased  at constant pressure.

3.2.6 Derivation of Absolute Zero
In  order to derive absolute zero of temperature, consider the following qu antitative deinition of 
Charles’s law.
At constant pressure, the volume of the given mass of a gas increa ses or decreases by 1/273 of its 
original volume at 0oC for every 1 °C rise or fall in temperature respectively.
In order to understand the above statement, look at the Table (3.1) of tem perature volume data of 
a hypothetical gas. At 0 oC the volume of the gas taken is 546 cm3 It is twice 273cm3, and is being 
supposed for the sake of convenience of understanding. At 273 oC, the volume of the gas has 
doubled (1092 cm3) and it should become practically zero at -273oC. The general equation to know 
the volumes of the gas at various temperatures is
Vt = Vo(1+ 273t  ) ………. (3)
Where        Vt = volume of gas at temperature T
Vo = Volume of gas at 0oC
t = Temperature on centigrade or celsius scale
If a gas is warmed by 1oC, it expands by 1
273 of its original volume at 0oC. Since original volume is 
546 cm3 ,so, for 1oC rise in temperature, 2 cm3  increase in volume will take place. 2cm3 is the 1
273 of 
546 cm3. Similarly, for 100 oC rise in temperature, a change of 200 cm3 will take place. The 
Table (3.1) shows that the volume does not increase corresponding to i ncrease in temperature on 
celsius scale. For example, the increase in temperature from 10 oC to 100 oC, increases the volume 
from 566cm3 to 746cm3.
Applying Charles’s law 
        12

The two sides of equation are not equal. So, Charles’s law is not b eing obeyed when temperature 
is measured on the Celsius scale.
For this reason a new temperature scale has been developed. It starts fr om 273 °C (more precisely 
-273.16 °C) which is called zero Kelvin or zero absolute. Let us now explain how the new temperature 
scale has been developed. The best way is to plot a graph between the var iables of Charles’s law.123.GASES eLearn.Punjab

Graphical Explanation
If we plot a graph between temperature on x-axis and 
the volume of one mole of an ideal gas on y-axis, we 
get a straight line which cuts the temperature axis at 
-273.16 °C. This can be possible only if we extrapolate 
the graph upto -273.16 oC. This temperature is the 
lowest possible temperature, which would have been 
achieved if the substance remains in the gaseous 
state Fig (3.7). Actually, all the gases are converted 
into liquids above this temperature.
Fig (3.7) The graph between volume
and temperature for a gas according
to Table (3.1).133.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Charles’s  law is obeyed when the temperature is taken on the Kelvin  scale. For example, at 283 K 
(10 oC) the volume is 566 cm3, while at 373 K (100 oC) the volume is,746cm3 Table (3.1). According to 
Charles’s law.

12VV=TT =K
566 7462283 373K = = =
Greater the mass of gas taken, greater will be the slope of straight line. The reason is that greater 
the number of moles greater the volume occupied. All these straight lin es when extrapolated meet 
at a single point of -273.16 °C ( 0 Kelvin). It is apparent that this temperature of -273.16 °C will be 
attained when the volume becomes zero. But for a real gas the zero volume i s impossible which 
shows that this temperature can not be attained for a real gas. Thi s is how we recognize that 
-273.16 °C must represent the coldest temperature.
3.2.7 Scales of Thermometry
There are three scales of thermometery which are used for temperature meas urements.
(a) Centigrade Scale:  It has a zero mark for the temperature of ice at one atmospheric pr essure. 
The mark 100°C indicates the temperature of boiling water at 1 a tmospheric pressure. The space 
between these temperature marks is divided into 100 equal parts and  each part is 1°C.
(b) Fahrenheit Scale: The melting point of ice at 1 atmospheric pressure has a mark 3 2°F and that 
of boiling water is 212 oF. The space between these temperature marks is divided into 180 equ al 
parts and each part is 1 oF.
(c) Absolute or Kelvin Scale: The melting Point of ice at 1 atmospheric pressure is 273K. The water 
boils at 373K or more precisely at 373.16K. 
Temperature on Kelvin scale = Temperature °C + 273.16 
Following relationships help us to understand the interconversion of  various scales of temperatures.
K = ° C + 273.16
°C = 5/9[°F-32]
oF =9/5(°C)+32143.GASES eLearn.Punjab
3.3 GENERAL GAS EQUATION 
While describing Boyle’s and Charles’s laws, some of the varia bles are held constant during the 
changes produced in the gases. According to Boyle’s law.
1VP∝
  (when ‘n‘ and ‘T’ are held constant)
According to Charles’s law
VT∝ (when n and P are held constant)
It is a well known fact that volume of the given gas at constant temper ature and pressure is directly 
proportional to the number of moles (Avogadro’s law).
Vn∝ (when Pand T a re held constant)
If we think for a moment that none of the variables are to be kept consta nt then all the
above three relationships can be joined together.
     nTVP∝
    V= Constant nT
P
The constant suggested is R which is called general gas constan t.
        nTV=RP
PV = nRT ............ (4)
The equation (4)  is called an ideal gas equation. It is als o known as general gas equation. This equation 
shows that if we have any quantity of an ideal gas then the pr oduct of its pressure and volume is 
equal to the product of number of moles, general gas constant and ab solute temperature. This 
equation is reduced to Boyle’s law, Charles’s law and Avogadro’s  law, when appropriate variables 
are held constant.
PV = nRT, when T and n are held constant, PV = k (Boyle’s l aw)
V = R nT
P, when P and n are held constant, V = kT (Charles’s law)
 V = R nT
P , when P and T are held constant V = kn (Avogadro’s law)
For one mole of a gas, the general gas equation is
PV = RT or   PV
T= R153.GASES eLearn.Punjab
It means that ratio of PV to T is a constant quantity (molar gas c onstant)

3.3.1 Ideal Gas Constant R
The values and units of R can be calculated by Avogadro's pri nciple very easily. Its value depends 
upon the units chosen for pressure, volume and temperature. The volume of one mole of an ideal 
gas at STP (one atmospheric pressure and 273.16 K ) is 22.4 14 dm3.
Putting these values in the general gas equation will give the value of R.
R= PV
nT
Putting their values, alongwith units
R= 31 atm x 22.414 dm
1 mole x 273.16 K
R = 0.0821 dm3 atm K-1 mol-1
When the pressure is in atmospheres, volume in dm3, then the value of R, used should be 0.0821 
dm3  atm K-1 mol-1
The physical meanings of this value is that, if we have one mole of  an ideal gas at 273.16 K and 
one atmospheric pressure and its temperature is increased by 1 K, then it will absorb 0.0821 dm3 
-atm of energy, dm3 -atm is the unit of energy in this situation. Hence, the value of R i s a universal 
parameter for all the gases. It tells us that the Avogadro’s number of  molecules o f all the ideal 
gases have the same demand of energy.163.GASES eLearn.Punjab
If the  pressure is expressed in mm of mercury or torr and the vol ume of the gas in cm3 then 
values of R are,
R = 0.0821 dm3 atm K-1 mol-1
= 0.0821 x 760 dm3 mm Hg K-1 mol-1
= 62.4 dm3 mm Hg K-1 mol-1 Since, (1 mm o f Hg = 1 to rr)
= 62.4 dm3 torr K-1 mol-1
= 62400 cm3 torr K-1 mol-1 As, (1 dm3 = 1000 cm )
Using SI units of pressure, volume and temperature in the general equ ation, the value of R is 
calculated as follows. The SI units of pressure are Nm-2 and of volume are m3. By using Avogadro’s 
principle
1 atm = 760 torr = 101 325 Nm-2
lm3 = 1000 dm3
n = 1 mole
T = 273.16 K
P = 1 atm = 101325 Nm-2
V = 22.414 dm3 = 0.022414 m3
Putting their values, alongwith units.
R= PV
nT = -2 3101325 N m  x 0.0224l m
1 mol x 273.16 K
  R = 8.3143 Nm K-1 mol-1 = 8.3143 J K-1 mol-1 (1 Nm = 1J)
Since 1cal. = 4.18 J
so R=8.3143
4.18= 1.989cal K-1 mol-1
Keep in mind that, wherever the pressure is given in Nm-2 and the volume in m3, then the value of 
R used must be 8.3143 JK-1 mol-1.
3.3.2 Density of an  ideal Gas
For calculating the density of an ideal gas, we substitute the valu e of number of moles (n) of the 
gas in terms of the mass (m), and the molar mass (M) of the ga s.
 n= m
M
PV = m
M RT   .................  (6)173.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Equation (6 ) is an  other form of general gas equation that may  be employed to calculate the mass 
of a gas whose P, T, V and molar mass are known. Rearrang ing equation (6)
PM = m
V R T
PM = d RT         (d= m
V) 
d= PM
RT                 .................................. ..... (7) 
 
Hence the  density of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its m olar mass. Greater the pressure 
on the gas, closer will be the molecules and greater the density. H igher temperature makes the 
gases to expand, hence density falls with the increase in temperatu re. With the help of equation 
(7), one can calculate the relative molar mass (M ) of an id eal gas if its temperature, pressure and 
density are known.
Example 3
A sample of nitrogen gas is enclosed in a vessel of volume 380 cm3 at 120 oC and pressure of 101325 
Nm-2 .This gas is transferred to a 10 dm3 lask and cooled to 27oC. Calculate the pressure in Nm-2 
exerted by the gas at 27oC.

The increase of pressure has increased the density of CH4. The density has almost doubled by doubling the 
pressure. The reason is that increase of pressure makes the molec ules to come close to each other.

Calculate the mass of 1 dm3 of NH3 gas at 30 °C and 1000 mm Hg pressure, considering that NH3 is 
behaving ideally.

This is the mass of 1 dm3 of NH3 under the given conditions. In other words, it is the density of NH3, if it is acting 
as an ideal gas.
3.4 AVOGADRO’S LAW
According to this law, “equal volumes of all the ideal gases at the same temperat ure and 
pressure contain equal number of molecules”.  This statement is indirectly the same as has been 
used for evaluating the general gas constant R i.e., one mole of an i deal gas at 273.16K and one atm 
pressure has a volume of 22.414 dm3. Since one mole of a gas has Avogadro’s number of particles, 
so 22.414 dm3 of various ideal gases at S T P will have Avogadro’s number of molecules i.e. 6.02 x 
1023. 22.414 dm3 of a gas at 273.16 K and one atmospheric pressure has number  of molecules = 
6.02 x1O23.
 In other words, if we have one dm3 of each of H2, He, N2, O2 , and CO in separate vessels at STP, 
then the number of molecules in each will be 2.68 x 1022 This is obtained by dividing 6.02x 1023 with 
22.414 dm3 .
Similarly, when  the temperature or pressure are equally changed  for these four gases, then the 
new equal volumes i.e. 1dm3 each will have the same number of molecules i.e. 2 . 6 8 x 1022.
No  doubt, one dm3 of H2 at STP weighs approximately 0.0899 grams and one dm3 of O2 at STP 
weighs 1.4384 g, but their number of molecules are the same. Alth ough, oxygen molecule is 16 
times heavier than hydrogen, but this does not disturb the volume occupi ed, because molecules of 
the gases are widely separated from each other at STP One molecule is approximately at a distance 
of 300 times its own diameter from its neighbour at room temperature.213.GASES eLearn.Punjab
3.5 DALTON’S LAW OF PARTIAL PRESSURES
John Dalton studied the mixtures o f gases and gave his law of par tial pressures. According to this 
law, the total pressure exerted by a mixture of non-reactin g gases is equal to the sum of their 
individual partial pressures . Let the gases are designated as 1,2,3, and their partial press ures are 
p1, p2, p3.The total pressure (P) of the mixture of gases is given by
    Pt = p1+ p2 + p3
The partial pressure of a gas in a mixture of gases is the p ressure that it would exert on the walls of 
the container, if it were present all alone in that same volume under th e same temperature.
Let us have four cylinders of same volume, i.e., 10 dm3 each and three gases H2, CH4 and O2 are 
separately enclosed in irst three of them at the same temperature. Let their partial pressures be 
400 torr, 500 torr and 100 torr respectively. 
All these gases are transferred to a fourth cylinder of capacity 1 0 dm3 at the same temperature. 
According to Dalton’s law
   ( )
2 42 t H CH O
tP  = p  + p  + p = 400 + 500 + 100  torr
                             P  =  1000 t orr
These three non-reacting gases are behaving independently under the n ormal conditions. The 
rapidly moving molecules of each gas in a mixture have equal op portunities to collide with the walls 
of the container. Hence, each gas exerts a pressure independent of th e pressure of other gases. 
The total pressure is the result of total number of collisions per un it area in a given time.
Molecules of each gas move independently, so the general gas equation (PV = nRT ) can be applied 
to the individual gases in the gaseous mixture.

All these gases have their own partial pressures. Since volumes a nd temperatures are the same, so 
their number of moles will be diferent and will be directly propor tional to their partial pressures.

According  to equation (8), the total pressure of the mixture of gases  depends upon the total 
number of moles of the gases.
3.5.1 Calculation of Partial Pressure of a Gas
The partial pressure of any gas in a mixture of gases can b e calculated, provided one knows the 
mass of that gas or its number of moles alongwith the total pressur e and the total number of moles 
present in the mixture.
In order to have a relationship, let us suppose that we have a mixture of gas A and gas B. This 
mixture is enclosed in a container having volume (V). The total pr essure is one atm.
The number of moles of the gases A and B are nA and nB respectively. If they are maintained at 
temperature T, then

Similarly
Partial pressure of a gas is the mole fraction of that gas mul tiplied by the total pressure of the 
mixture. Remember that mole fraction of anyone of the gases in the mi xture is less than unity. 
Moreover, the sum of mole fractions is always equal to unity.
Example 6
There is a mixture of hydrogen, helium and methane occupying a vessel of volume 13 dm3 at 37 °C 
and pressure of 1 atmosphere. The masses of H2 and He are 0.8 g and 0.12 g respectively. Calculate 
the partial pressures in torr of each gas in the mixture.

3.5.2 Applications of Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressur es
Following are the four important applications of Dalton’s Law of pa rtial pressures.
1.  Some gases are collected over water in the laboratory. The gas d uring collection gathers 
water vapours and becomes moist. The pressure exerted by this moist gas is, therefore, the sum of 
the partial pressures of the dry gas and that of water vapours. ( )22 2

The partial pressure exerted by the water vapours is called aqueous tension.

moist dry
dry moistP      = p    +   p

p       =  P    -    aqueous tension
While solving the numericals the aqueous tension is subtracted from the total pressure (P moist).
2.  Dalton's law inds its applications during the process of r espiration. The process of respiration 
depends upon the diference in partial pressures. When animals i nhale air then oxygen moves into 
lungs as the partial pressure of oxygen in the air is 159 tor r, while the partial pressure of oxygen 
in the lungs 116 torr. CO2 produced during respiration moves out in the opposite direction, as it's 
partial pressure is more in the lungs than that in air.
3.  At higher altitudes, the pilots feel uncomfortable breathing b ecause the partial pressure of 
oxygen in the un-pressurized cabin is low, as compared to 159  torr, where one feels comfortable 
breathing.
4.  Deep sea divers take oxygen mixed with an inert gas say He and  adjust the partial pressure 
of oxygen according  to the requirement. Actually, in sea after ever y 100 feet depth, the diver 
experiences approximately 3 atm pressure, so normal air cannot be breathed in depth of sea. 
Moreover, the pressure of N2 increases in depth of sea and it difuses in the blood.
3.6 DIFFUSION AND EFFUSION 
Diffusion
According to the kinetic molecular theory of gases, the molecules of the gases move haphazardly. 
They collide among themselves, collide with the walls of the vessel  and change their directions. In 
other words the molecules of gases are scattered after collisions. 
This spontaneous intermingling of molecules of 
one gas with another at a given temperature and 
pressure is called difusion.
Fig (3.8) Diffusion263.GASES eLearn.Punjab
The spreading of fragrance of a rose or a scent is due to 
difusion. When two gases difuse into each other, they wish to 
make their partial pressures same every where. Suppose NO2, 
a brown coloured gas and O2, a colourless gas, are separated 
from each other by a partition Fig (3.8).When the partition is 
removed, both difuse into each other due to collisions and 
random motion.
A stage reaches when both gases generate a homogeneous 
mixture and partial pressures of both are uniform throughout 
the mixture.
Effusion
The efusion of a gas is it's movement through an extremely small open ing into a region of low 
pressure. This spreading of molecules is not due to collisions, b ut due to their tendency to escape 
one by one. Actually, the molecules of a gas are habitual in c olliding with the walls of the vessel. 
When a molecule approaches just in front of the opening it enters the oth er portion of the vessel. 
This type of escape of molecules is called of efusion  Fig( 3.9).
3.6.1 Graham 's Law of Diffusion
Thomas  Graham (1805 -1869), an English scientist, found that the rate of difusion or efusion 
of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of it's density at constant temperature and 
pressure.

      Rate of diffusion x   d    = k

The constant k is same for all gases, when they are all studied  at the same temperature and pressure.
Let us have two gases 1 and 2, having rates of difusion as r1 and r2 and densities as d1 and d2 respectively.
According to Graham's law
      11
22r  x d   = k
r  x d   = k
Divide the two equations and rearrange
Since the density of a given gas is directly proportional to its m olecular mass. Graham’s law of difusion can also 
be written as follows.
Where M1 and M2 are the molar masses of gases.
Demonstration of Graham‘s Law
This law can also be very easily veriied in the laboratory by noti ng the rates of  difusion of two 
gases in a glass tube, when they are allowed to move from opposite end s Fig (3.10). Two cotton 
plugs soaked in HCl and NH3 solutions are introduced in the open ends of 100 cm long tube 
simultaneously. HCl molecules travel a distance of 40.5 cm wh ile NH3 molecules cover 59.5 cm 
in the same duration. They produce dense white fumes of ammonium chloride at the point of 
junction. So
  1.46  =  1.46
Hence the law is veriied.2 1

3.7 KINETIC MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES
The behaviour of gases has already been discussed in gas la ws. These laws were based on 
experimental observations quite independent of nature of a gas. In order  to illustrate the 
behaviour of gases quantitatively, Bernoulli (1738) put forward k inetic molecular theory of gases.
This theory lead Clausius (1857) to derive the kinetic equation an d deduced all the gas laws from 
it. The theory was later on elaborated and extended by Maxwell, who gave the law of distribution 
of velocities. According to this law,molecules are in the form of grou ps having deinite velocity 
ranges. Boltzmann also Contributed and studied the distribution of energies among the gas 
molecules. Among some other names Van der Waal is the prominent sci entist in this ield.( )

Following are the fundamental postulates of this kinetic theory of g ases.
1. Every gas consists of a large number of very small particles ca lled molecules. Gases like He, Ne, 
Ar have monoatomic molecules.
2. The molecules of a gas move haphazardly, colliding among them selves and with the walls of the 
container and change their directions.
3. The pressure exerted by a gas is due to the collisions of its molecu les with the walls of a container. 
The collisions among the molecules are perfectly elastic.
4. The molecules of a gas are widely separated from one another and ther e are suicient empty 
spaces among them.
5. The molecules of a gas have no forces of attraction for each other .
6. The actual volume of molecules of a gas is negligible as c ompared to the volume of the gas.
7. The motion imparted to the molecules by gravity is negligible as comp ared to the efect of the 
continued collisions between them. 
8. The  average kinetic energy of the gas molecules varies directly as  the absolute temperature of 
the gas. 
Keeping   in  view  the  basic     assumptions       given   above, R.J Clausius deduced an expression for the pressure 
of an ideal gas. Actually,pressure on the walls of the vessel is due to collisions. Whenever the molecules 
move they collide among themselves and with the walls of the container . Due to these collisions,a 
force is exerted on the walls of the container. This force when di vided by the area of the vessel gives 
force per unit area, which  is called  pressure. In this way , the  inal  form  of  kinetic equation is as follows.

The idea of the mean square velocity is important. All the molecules of a gas under
the given conditions don’t have the same velocities. Rather diferent velocities are
distributed among the molecules. To understand it study Maxwell’s law of distribution of
velocities. If there are n1 molecules with velocity c1, n2 molecules with velocity c2, and so on
then,

2cis the average of the squares of all the possible velocities. When w e take the square root of this 
2c, then it is called root mean square velocity (Crms). So, (Crms) = 2c
The expression for the root mean square velocity deduced from the kinetic  equation is written as 
follows.

               M     = molar mass of the  gas

This  equation (15) is a quantitative relationship between the abs olute temperature and the 
velocities of the gas molecules. According to this equation, higher th e temperature of a gas, greater 
the velocities. Kinetic equation can be used to explain gas laws.

Their kinetic equations can be written as follows:

3.8 KINETIC INTERPRETATION OF TEMPERATURE
According to kinetic molecular theory of gases the molecules of a ga s move randomly. They collide 
among themselves, with the walls of the vessels and change their dir ections. The collisions are 
elastic and the pressure of the gas is the result of these collision s with the walls of the container.
Let us rewrite the kinetic equation of gases (13) as already mention ed

The equation (27) gives a new deinition of temperature according to wh ich the kelvin temperature 
of a gas is directly proportional to the average translational kinetic  energy of its molecules. This 
suggests that a change in temperature means change in the intensity  of molecular motion. When 
heat lows from one body to another, the molecules in the hotter body give up some of their kinetic 
energy through collisions to molecules in the colder body. This proc ess of low of heat continues 
until the average translational kinetic energies of all the molecules become equal. This equalises 
the temperature of both bodies. 
In gases and liquids, temperature is the measure of average trans lational kinetic energies of 
molecules. In solids, where molecules cannot move freely temperature becom es a measure of 
vibrational kinetic energy. 
Keeping in view this kinetic interpretation of temperature, w e have a way of looking at absolute 
zero of temperature. It is that temperature at which the molecular motion s cease. The absolute 
zero is unattainable. Anyhow, current attempts have resulted in temper ature as low as 10-5K.
3.9 LIQUEF ACTION OF GASES
3.9.1 General Principle of Liquefaction
The conversion of a gas into a liquid requires high pressure a nd low temperature. High pressure 
brings the molecules of a gas close to each other. Low temperature dep rives the molecules from 
kinetic energy and attractive forces start dominating.
For every gas there exists a temperature above which the gas cannot be li queied, no matter how 
much pressure is applied. The highest temperature at which a substance can exist as  a liquid, 
is called its  critical temperature (Tc). There is a corresponding pressure which is required to 
bring about liquefaction at this critical temperature (Tc). This is called critical pressure (Pc).
The critical temperature and the critical pressure of the substan ces are very important for the 
workers dealing with the gases. These properties provide us the inf ormation about the condition 
under which gases liquefy. For example, O2 has a critical temperature 154.4 K (-118.75 °C). It must 
be cooled below this temperature before it can be liqueied by applying  high pressure. Ammonia is 
a polar gas. Its critical temperature is 405.6 K (132.44 °C ), so it can be liqueied by applying suicient 
pressure close to room temperature.363.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Table (3.2) shows the critical parameters of some common substan ces. Non- polar gases of low 
polarizability like Ar have a very low critical temperature. T he substances like H2O vapours and NH3 
gas are among the polar gases and they have better tendencies to be liqu eied CO2, can not be 
liqueied above 31.1 oC, no matter how much the pressure is applied. Anyhow, if tempera ture of 
CO2 is maintained below 31.1 oC, then lower pressure than critical pressure is required to liq uefy 
it. The value of the critical temperature of a gas depends upon its s ize, shape and intermolecular 
forces present in it.
When a gas is measured at its critical temperature and critica l pressure, then at that stage volume 
of 1 mole of gas is called critical volume which is represented by Vc. The critical volume of O2 is 
74.42 cm3 mol-1, of CO2 , is 95.65 cm3 mol-1 and that of H2 is 64.51 cm3 mol-1.

3.9.2 Methods of Liquefaction of Gases
There are various methods to liquefy a gas . One of them is Linde’ s method. It is based on Joule-
Thomson efect.
Joule Thomson Efect
Low temperature can be achieved by Joule-Thomson efect, according to wh ich when a compressed 
gas is allowed to expand into a region of low pressure it gets cool ed.
The molecules of the compressed gas are very close to each other and app reciable attractive 
forces are present among them. When a gas is allowed to undergo sud den expansion through 
the nozzle of a jet, then the molecules move apart. In this way energy is needed to overcome the 
intermolecular attractions. This energy is taken from the gas its elf, which is cooled.373.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Linde’s Method of Liquefaction of Gases
Linde has employed Joule-Thomson efect as the basis for liquefaction . The apparatus designed for 
this purpose is shown in the Fig (3.11).
For the liquefaction of air, it is compressed to about 200 atmospheres , and then passed though a 
water cooled pipe where the heat of compression is removed. It is th en allowed to pass through a 
spiral pipe having a jet at the end. When the air comes out of the jet the expansion takes place from 
200 atm. to 1 atm. In this way, considerable fall of temperatur e occurs. 
This  cooled air goes up and cools the incoming compressed air.  It returns to the compression 
pump. This process is repeated again and again. The liqui d air is collected at the bottom of the 
expansion chamber. All gases except H2, and He can be liqueied by the above procedure.
3.10 NON-IDEAL BEHAVIOUR OF GASES
Whenever, we discuss gas laws it.is proposed that ideal gases ob ey them. Particularly an ideal gas 
obeys Boyle’s law, Charles’s law and the general gas equation u nder all conditions of temperature 
and pressure. Let us try to understand the behaviour of a few real g ases like H2, He, N2 and CO2 
at °C.keeping in view the variation of the pressure on the gas and consequently the change in its 
volume. 
Fig (3.11) Linde's method for
the liquefaction of air

For this purpose,  irst of all plot a graph between 
pressure on x-axis and the   PV
nRT  on Y-axis for an ideal 
gas. 
The factor PV
nRT is called the compressibility factor. Its 
value  is unity under all conditions for an ideal gas. 
Since the increase of pressure decreases the volume 
in such a way that PV
nRTremains constant at a constant 
temperature, so a straight line is obtained parallel to 
the pressure axis. This is shown in the Figs (3.12 a, b).  
All the real gases have been found to show marked 
deviations from this behaviour. It is observed that the 
graph for helium gas goes along with the expected horizontal dotted l ine to some extent but goes 
above this line at very high pressures.
lt means that at very high pressure the decrease in volume is not a ccording to general gas equation 
and the value of  PV
RT   has increased from the expected values. With this type of behaviou r, we 
would say that the gas is non-ideal. 
In the case of H2 the deviation starts even at low pressure in comparison to He. N2 shows a decrease 
in PV
RT  value at the beginning and shows marked deviation even at low pres sure than H2. CO2 has a 
very strange behaviour as it is evident from the graph.
The extent of deviation of these four gases shows that these gases have their  own limitations 
for obeying general gas equation. It depends upon the nature of the g as that at which value of 
pressure, it will start disobeying.
When we study the behaviour of all these four gases at elevated temperatur e i.e., 100oC then the 
graphs come closer to the expected straight line and the deviations are shifted towards higher 
pressure. This means that the increase in temperature makes the g ases ideal Fig (3.12 b).
This discussion on the basis of experimental observations, 
convinces us that
(i) Gases are ideal at low pressure and non-ideal at high 
pressure
(ii) Gases are ideal at high temperature and non-ideal at 
low temperature.

of gases at 100 °C.

3.10.1 Causes for Deviations from Ideality
It was van der W aals (1873) who attributed the deviation 
of real gases from ideal behaviour to two of the eight 
postulates of kinetic molecular theory of gases.
These postulates are as under.
(i) There are no forces of attraction among the molecules 
of a gas.
(ii) The actual volume of gas molecules is negligible as 
compared to the volume of the vessel.
When the pressure on a gas is high and the temperature 
is low then the attractive forces among the molecules 
become signiicant, so the ideal gas equation PV = nRT 
does not hold. Actually, under these conditions, the gas does not rem ain ideal.The actual volume 
of the molecules of a gas is usually very small as compared to the volume of the vessel and hence 
it can be neglected. This volume, however, does not remain negligible w hen the gas is subjected to 
high pressure. This can be understood from the following Figs (3.13 a, b).
3.10.2 van der Waals Equation for Real Gases
Keeping in view the above discussion, van der Waals pointed out that b oth pressure and volume 
factors in ideal gas equation needed correction in order to make it ap plicable to the real gases.
Volume Correction
When a gas is compressed, the molecules are pushed so close together that the repulsive forces 
operate between them. When pressure is increased further it is opposed by the molecules 
themselves. Actually the molecules have deinite volume, no doubt very small  as compared to the 
vessel, but it is not negligible. So van der Waals postulated that th e actual volume of molecules can 
no longer be neglected in a highly compressed gas. If the efective volu me of the molecules per 
mole of a gas is represented by b, then the volume available to gas molecules is the volume of the 
vessel minus the volume of gas molecules.
 = V  - b             ...........        (28)free vesselV
Kig(3.13.b) A gas at high 
pressure when actual volume 
is not negligible.Fig(3.13.a) A gas at low 
pressure w hen actual 
volume is negligible.403.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Vfreeis that volume which is available to gas molecules. The factor b is termed as the excluded volume 
which is constant and characteristic of a gas. It’s value dep ends upon the size of gas molecules. 
Table (3.3) shows the b values for some important gases. It is in teresting to know that the excluded 
volume b is not equal to the actual volume of gas molecules. In fact,  it is four times the actual 
volume of molecules.
b = 4Vm
Where Vm is the actual volume of one mole of gas molecules, 'b' is efective volu me or excluded volume of one 
mole of a gas. It is that volume of gas which is occupied by 1  mole of gas molecules in highly compressed state, 
but not in the liquid state.
Pressure Correction
A molecule in the interior of a gas is attracted by other molecules on all sides, so these attractive 
forces are cancelled out. However, when a molecule strikes the wall  of a container, it experiences 
a force of attraction towards the other molecules in the gas. This dec reases the force of its impact 
on the wall. Consider the molecule "A" which is unable to create pressure on the wall due to the 
presence of attractive forces due to 'B' type molecules Fig (3.14). L et the observed pressure on the 
wall of the container is P. This pressure is less than the actua l pressure Pi, by an amount P', so
P = Pi - P'
Pi is the true kinetic pressure, if the forces of attractions would ha ve been absent. P' is the amount 
of pressure lessened due to attractive forces. Ideal pressure Pi is
Pi = P + P’
It is suggested that a part of the pressure P for one mole of a gas  used up against intermolecular 
attractions should decrease as volume increases. Consequently, the valu e of P' in terms of a constant 
'a' which accounts for the attractive forces and the volume V of vess el can be written as
How to prove it
P’ is determined by the forces of attraction between molecules of type A, which are striking the wall 
of the container and molecules of type B, which are pulling them i nward. The net force of attraction 
is proportional to the concentrations of A type and B type molecules.

Greater the attractive forces among the gas molecules, smaller the volume of  vessel, greater the 
value of lessened pressure P’.
This ‘a’ is called co-eicient of attraction or attraction per unit vol ume. It has a constant value for a 
particular real gas. Thus efective kinetic pressure of a gas is  given by Pi, which is the pressure if the 
gas would have been ideal.

constructed by taking pressure as 2( P  +   )a

3.11 PLASMA STATE
What is plasma?
Plasma is often called the “fourth state of matter”, the other three bei ng solid, liquid and g a s. Plasma 
was identiied by the English scientist William Crookes in 1879 . In addition to being important in 
many aspects of our daily life, plasmas are estimated to constitu te more than 99 percent of the 
visible universe. Although, naturally occurring plasma is ra re on earth, there are many man-made 
examples. 
Inventors have used plasma to conduct electricity in neon signs and  luorescent bulbs. Scientists 
have constructed special chambers to experiment with plasma in l aboratories. It occurs only in 
lightning discharges and in artiicial devices like luorescent lights, neon signs, etc. It is everywhere 
in our space environment.
How is Plasma formed ?
When more heat is supplied, the atoms or molecules may be ionized.
An electron may gain enough energy to escape its atom. This atom los es 
one electron and develops a net positive charge. It becomes an ion. In a  
suiciently heated gas, ionization happens many times, creating c louds of 
free electrons and ions. However, all the atoms are not necessarily ion ized, 
and some of them may remain completely intact with no net charge. Th is 
ionized gas mixture, consisting of ions, electrons and neutral a toms is called 
plasma.
It means that a plasma is a distinct state of matter containing a signiicant 
number of electrically charged particles a number suicient to af ect its 
electrical properties and behaviour.463.GASES eLearn.Punjab
Natural and Artiicial Plasma
Artiicial plasma can be created by ionization of a gas. as i n neon signs. Plasma at low temperatures 
is hard to maintain because outside a vacuum low temperature plasm a reacts rapidly with any 
molecule it encounters. This aspect makes this material, both very u seful and hard to use. Natural 
plasma exists only at very high temperatures, or low temperature vac uums.
Natural plasma on the other hand do not breakdown or react rapidly , but is extremely hot (over 
20,000°C minimum). Their energy is so high that they vaporize any material they touch.
Characteristic of Plasma:
1. A plasma must have suicient number of charged particles so as a whole, it exhibits a collective 
response to electric and magnetic ields. The motion of the particles in  the plasma generate 
ields and electric currents from within plasma density. It refer s to the density of the charged 
particles. This complex set of interactions makes plasma a uniq ue, fascinating, and complex 
state of matter.
2. Although plasma includes electrons and ions and conducts electri city, it is macroscopically 
neutral. In measurable quantities the number of electrons and ions are equal.
Where is Plasma found ?
Entire universe is almost of plasma. It existed before any other f orms of matter came into being. 
Plasmas are found in everything from the sun to quarks, the sm allest particles in the universe.
As stated earlier plasma is the most abundant form of matter 
in the universe. It is the stuf of stars. A majority of the matter 
in inner-stellar space is plasma. All the stars that shine  are all 
plasma. The sun is a 1.5 million kilometer ball of plasma,  heated 
by nuclear fusion.

One arth it only occurs in a few limited places, like lightnin g bolts, lames, auroras, and luorescent 
lights. When an electric current is passed through neon gas, it produces both plasma and light.
Applications of Plasma: 
Plasma has numerous important technological applications. It is  present in many devices. It helps 
us to understand much of the universe around us. Because plasmas ’ are conductive respond 
to electric and magnetic ields and can be eicient sources of radia tion, so they can be used in 
innumerable applications where such control is needed or when s pecial sources of energy or 
radiation are required.
1. A luorescent light bulb is not like regular light bulbs. Insi de the long tube is a gas. When the light 
is turned on, electricity lows through the tube. This electricity acts  as that special energy and 
charges up the gas. This charging and exciting of the atoms creates a glowing plasma inside the 
bulb.
2. Neon signs are glass tubes illed with gas. When they are 
turned on then the electricity lows through the tube. The 
electricity charges the gas, possibly neon, and creates a 
plasma inside the tube. The plasma glows with a special

Future Horizons:
Scientists are working on putting plasma to efective use. Plasma wou ld have to be low energy and 
should be able to survive without instantly reacting and degeneratin g. The application of magnetic 
ields involves the use of plasma. The magnetic ields create low energy  plasma which create 
molecules that are in what scientist call a metastable state. The mag netic ields used to create 
the low temperature plasma give the plasma molecules, which do not react until they collide with 
another molecule with just the right energy. This enables these metastab le molecules to survive 
long enough to react with a designated molecule. These metastable parti cles are selective in their 
reactivity. It makes them a potentially unique solution to problems l ike radioactive contamination. 
Scientist are currently experimenting with mixtures of gases to work as metastable agents on 
plutonium and uranium, and this is just the beginning.493.GASES eLearn.Punjab
KEY POINTS
1. The behaviour of a gas is described through four variables i.e.,  pressure, volume , temperature 
and its number of moles. The relationships between gas variables are known as the simple gas 
laws. Boyle’s law relates pressure of a gas with its volume, whi le Charles’s law relates gas volume 
with temperature. Avogadro’s law is concerned with volume and amoun t of a gas. The important 
concept of absolute zero of temperature originates from the simple gas l aws.
2. By combining  the above mentioned three laws, a more general equation a bout the behaviour 
of gas is obtained i.e., PV = n RT. This equation can be sol ved for any one of the variables when 
values for others are known. This equation can be modiied for the deter mination of molar 
masses and the density of the gas.
3. Dalton’s law of partial pressures can be used to calculate the partial pressures of gases.
4. The processes of difusion and efusion are best understood by Graham ’s law of difusion.
5. Kinetic molecular theory of gases provides a theoretical basis for va rious gas laws. With the help 
of this theory a relationship is established between average molecul ar kinetic energy and kelvin 
temperature. The  difusion and efusion of the gases can be related to their molar masses 
through the kinetic molecular theory of gases.
6. The real gases show ideal behaviour  under speciic conditions. T hey become non-ideal at high 
pressure and low temperature. The non-ideal behaviour results chiely  from intermolecuiar 
attractions and the inite volume occupied by the gas molecules.
7. Gases can  be liquiied by applying suicient pressure but temper ature should either be critical 
one or below it.
8. To  calculate the pressure or volume of a real gas under the non- ideal conditions, alternative 
kinetic equation has been developed. This is known as the van der Wa al’s equation.
9. The  plasma, a forth state of matter, consist of neutral particles,  positive ions and negative 
electrons, 99% of the known universe is in the plasma state.503.GASES eLearn.Punjab
