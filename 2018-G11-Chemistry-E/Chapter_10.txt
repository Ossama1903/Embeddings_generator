INTRODUCTION
 Electrochemistry is concerned with the conversion of electrical energ y into chemical energy 
in electrolytic cells as well as the conversion of chemical energy i nto electrical energy in galvanic or 
voltaic cells.
 In an electrolytic cell, a process called electrolysis takes pl ace. In this process electricity is 
passed through a solution or the fused state of electrolyte. The electricity  provides suicient energy 
to cause an otherwise non-spontaneous oxidation-reduction reaction to ta ke place. A galvanic 
cell, on the other hand, provides a source of electricity. This s ource of electricity results from a 
spontaneous oxidation-reduction reaction taking place in the solution .
 First of all, we should learn, the theoretical background of oxi dation and reduction reaction 
and try to understand the balancing of equation.

10.1 OXIDATION STATE AND BALANCING OF REDOX EQUATIO NS
10.1.1 Oxidation Number or State
 It is the apparent charge on an atom of an element in a molecule or an ion. It may be positive 
or negative or zero.
Rules for Assigning Oxidation Number
(i)  The oxidation number of all elements in the free state is zer o. This is often shown as a zero 
written on the symbol. For example, o
2H, o
Na, o
Mg.
(ii) The oxidation number of an ion, consisting of a single el ement, is the same as the charge on the 
ion. For example, the oxidation number of K+, Ca2+, Al3+ , Br- , S2- are + 1, +2, +3, -1, -2, respectively.
(iii) The oxidation number of hydrogen in all its compounds ex cept metal hydrides is +1. In metal 
hydrides it is -1. (Na+H- , Mg2+ H2(-1)2)
(iv) The oxidation number of oxygen in all its compounds except i n peroxides, OF2 and in super 
oxides is -2. It is -1 in peroxides +2 in OF2 and -1/2 in super oxides.
(v) In neutral molecules, the algebraic sum of the oxidation numb ers of all the elements is zero.
(vi) In ions, the algebraic sum of oxidation number equals the charge on the ion.
(vii) In any substance the more electronegative atom has the negative oxid ation number.

10.1.2 To Find Oxidation Number of an Element in a C ompound or a Radical
 The oxidation number or state of any atom of an element present in a compound or a radical 
can be determined by making use of the above said rules.
Example 1:
 Calculate the oxidation number (O.N) of manganese in 4KMnO .
Solution
 (Oxidation number of K) + (oxidation number of Mn )+4 (oxid ation number of O) = 0
 Where   oxidation number of K   = +1
    oxidation number of O   = -2
Let     oxidation number of Mn   = x
 Putting these values in the above equation.
     (+1) + x + 4(-2)    = 0
 or       x    = +7
Thus the oxidation state of Mn in 4KMnO is + 7.
Example 2:
 Calculate the oxidation number (O.N) of sulphur in 2-
4SO .510 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
Solution
 [oxidation number of S] + 4[oxidation number of O ]   = -2
        x + 4 (-2 )    = -2
         x    = +6
 Thus the oxidation number of sulphur in 2-
4SO  is + 6 .
10.1.3 Balancing of Redox Equations by Oxidation Numbe r Method
 Carry out the following steps for balancing of redox equations b y oxidation number method.
(i)   Write down the skeleton equation of the redox reaction under cons ideration.
(ii)  Identify the elements, which undergo a change in their oxid ation number during the reaction.
(iii)  Record the oxidation number above the symbols of the element, w hich have undergone a 
change in the oxidation number.
(iv)  Indicate the change in oxidation number by arrows joining  the atoms on both sides of the 
equation. It shows number of electrons gained or lost.
(v)  Equate the increase or decrease in the oxidation number, i. e. electrons gained or lost by 
multiplying with a suitable digit.
(vi)  Balance the rest of the equation by inspection method.610 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
Example 3:
 Balance the following equation by oxidation number method.
    2 27 3 2 2K Cr O  + HCl KCl + CrCl  + Cl  + H O →
Solution
 Let us balance the equation stepwise:
1.  Write the equation with the oxidation number of each element

2 27 3 2 2 K Cr O  + HCl KCl + CrCl  + Cl  + H O →
2 . Identify, those elements whose oxidation numbers have changed. E quation shows that Cr goes 
from + 6 to +3 and it is reduced. Cl goes from -1 to zero and is  oxidized. Moreover, the oxidation 
number of chlorine remains the same, i.e from -1 to -1 when KCl and CrCl3 are produced. So, 
we should write HCl, twice on the left hand side. One of HCI on left side shows those Cl atoms 
which do not change their oxidation numbers Other HCI shows those Cl atoms which undergo a 
change in their oxidation numbers.
   
3.  Draw the arrows between the same elements whose oxidation numbers have changed. Also, 
point out the change in oxidation number. Cr has changed its oxid ation number from + 6 to + 
3 and chlorine has changed from -1 to zero . It means 6 electron s have been gained by two Cr 
atoms and 1 electron has been lost by 1 chlorine atom.

2 27 3 2 2 HCl + K Cr O  + HCl KCl + CrCl  + Cl + H O →  
  2(+3e-)= +6e-reduction 
4.  In order to balance the number of electrons lost and gained mul tiply HCl with six. In this way, 
the 6 electrons lost by 6 Cl- will be gained by 2Cr+6 to give 2Cr+3. But do not multiply other HCl 
molecules with anything at this moment.
    2 27 3 2 2HCl + K Cr O  + 6HCl KCl + CrCl  + Cl  + H O →    reduction

2 27 3 2 2 HCl + K Cr O  + HCl KCl + CrCl  + Cl + H O → 
(does not change oxidation number ) oxidation810 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
5.  Let us, balance Cr atoms by multiplying CrCl3 by 2 . Balance Cl2 on right hand side, whose 
oxidation number has changed by multiplying it with 3. In this way, the atoms which have been 
oxidized and reduced get balanced.
    2 27 3 2 2HCl + K Cr O  + 6HCl KCl + 2CrCl  + 3Cl  + H O →
6 . To balance K atoms, multiply KCl by 2.
   2 27 3 2 2 HCl + K Cr O  + 6HCl 2KCl + 2CrCl  + 3Cl  + H O →
7. Now balance those atoms of chlorine which have not been oxidized or reduced. There are 8 such 
chlorine atoms on the right hand side with KC1 and 2CrCl3. So multiply HCl with eight. This HCl 
has produced KCl and CrCl3 .
    2 27 3 2 2 8HCl + K Cr O  + 6HCl 2KCl + 2CrCl  + 3Cl  + H O →
8 . Balance the rest of the equation by inspection method. To bala nce O atoms multiply H2O with 7.
    2 27 3 2 2 8HCl + K Cr O  + 6HCl 2KCl + 2CrCl  + 3Cl  + 7 HO →
or
    2 27 3 2 2 K Cr O  + 14HCl 2KCl + 2CrCl  + 3Cl  + 7H O →
 This is the inal balanced equation.
10.1.4 Balancing of Redox Equations by Ion-Electron Method
 The balancing of redox equations by the loss and gain of electr ons, usually involves quite 
a few ions, which do not undergo change in valence and which are not really necessary for the 
process of balancing. The ion-electron method eliminates all the un necessary ions and retains only 
those, which are essential. Following, are the general rules for b alancing the redox equations by 
ion-electron method.910 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
1. Write a skeleton equation that shows only those substances that are actu ally involved in the 
reaction.
2. Split the equation into two half reactions, one showing oxidation hal f reaction and the other 
reduction half reaction.
3. The element should not be written as a free atom or ion unless it r eally exists as such. It should 
be written as a real molecular or ionic species.
4. Balance each partial equation as to the number of atoms of each elemen t. In neutral or acidic 
solution, H2O or H+ ions may be added for balancing oxygen and hydrogen atoms.  Oxygen atoms 
are balanced irst. If the solution is alkaline, OH- may be used for each excess oxygen on one side 
of the equation.
5. Balance each half reaction as to the number of charges by addi ng electrons to either the left or 
the right side of the equation.
6. Multiply each half reaction by a number chosen so that the total nu mber of electrons lost by the 
reducing agent equals the number of electrons gained by the oxidiz ing agent
7. Add the two half reactions. Count the number of atoms of each element on  each side of the 
equation and also check the net charge on each side, which should  be equal on both sides.
          Balancing of redox equations by ion-electron method, ma king use of the above rules. There 
are two types of such reactions Le. in acidic medium and basi c medium. Now, let us discuss one 
example of each.
Example 4: (acidic medium)
 Balance the equation for the reaction of HCl with KMnO4 where Cl- is oxidized to Cl2 and MnO4- 
is reduced to Mn2+. The skeleton equation which does not contain either H+ or H2O, is
Solution
 It is clear that Cl- is oxidized to Cl2 and MnO1-
4 reduces to Mn2+

 Now, balance the reduction half reaction. To balance O-atoms, add 4H2O on R.H.S. and to 
balance H-atoms add 8H+ on L.H.S. The reason is that medium is acidic.

42 8H  + MnO + 5e Mn  + 4H O          .........   (4)+→
 For making the number of electrons lost in irst equation equal to the number of electron 
gained in the second equation, multiply the irst equation by 5 and  second by 2. After adding both 
equations and cancelling the common species on both sides, balanc ed equation is obtained.

10.2.0 ELECTROL YTIC CONDUCTION
 We know, that most metals are conductors of electricity because of the r elatively free 
movement of their electrons throughout the metallic lattice. This electronic conduction is simply 
called metallic conduction.
 Electrolytes in the form of solution or in the fused state have the abil ity to conduct electricity. 
In this case, the current is not carried by free electrons throu gh the solution or through the fused 
electrolyte. Here, the current is carried by ions having positive an d negative charges. These ions 
are produced in the solution or in fused state due to ionization of the electrolyte. Ionization is the 
process in which ionic compounds when fused or dissolved in w ater split up into charged particles 
called ions.

 Two electrodes are dipped in the solution of an electrolyte and electrol ysis takes place. This 
forms an electrolytic cell An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical  cell in which electric current is used 
to drive a non-spomaneous reaction. When a non-spontaneous reaction tak es place at the expense 
of electrical energy, the process is called electrolysis. During th is non-spontaneous reaction, the 
substances are deposited at respective electrodes and electrolyte is decompos ed. Examples of 
electrolytic cells are Down’s cell and Nelson’s cell, etc.1410 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
10.2.1 Electrochemical Cells
10.2.2 Electrolytic Cells.
 Look at the arrangement as shown in Fig. (10.1). It represents, an electrolytic cell, The electrolyte 
consists of positive and negative ions which are free to move in the solu tion. When a direct current 
(D.C) source is connected to the electrodes of the cell, each electrode ac quires an electric charge.
 Thus, on applying electric potential, the positive ions migrate towa rds the negative electrode, 
called cathode and the negative ions move towards the positive electrode, call ed the anode.

 This movement of ionic charges through the liquid brought by the application of electricity is 
called electrolytic conduction and the apparatus used is known as  electrolytic cell.  
When electrolytic conduction occurs, electrochemical reactions takes p lace. The ions in the liquid 
come in contact with the electrodes. At the anode the negative ions give up el ectrons and are, 
therefore, oxidized. At the cathode the positive ions pick up electrons an d are reduced. Thus during 
electrolytic conduction, oxidation takes place at the anode and the reduc tion takes place at the 
cathode. The liquid will continue to conduct electricity only as lon g as oxidation-reduction reactions, 
occurring at the electrodes, continue.
 The electrochemical reactions that occur at the electrodes during th e electrolytic conduction 
constitute the phenomenon of electrolysis.
 When a molten salt is electrolyzed , 
the products a re predictable. When an aqueous 
solution of a salt is electrolyzed, hydrogen and oxygen
appear at the cathode and anode, respectively in 
certain cases. The products formed from a few 
electrolytes are shown in Table (10. 1).

10.2.3 Explanation of Electrolysis
(a)  Fused Salts
 When a fused salt is electrolyzed, the metal ions called cations arrive at the cathode which 
being negatively, charged supply electrons to them and thus disch arge the cations. The anions 
move towards the anode, give up their electrons and are thus discharg ed. In the case of fused lead 
chloride, the equations for electrode processes are given as under.
  At anode: 2+ -
( ) ( s) Pb + 2e Pb →  (oxidation)
  At cathode: --
( ) 2(g)2Cl          Cl +2e →  (reduction)
So, oxidation happens at anode and reduction at the cathode.
 Similarly, for fused NaCl and fused PbBr2 the electrolytes are decomposed during electrolysis. 
Fused Pb and Na are deposited at cathode and Cl2(g) and Br2 at anode.
 Electrons low through the external circuit from anode to cathode. The el ectric current is 
conducted through the cell by the ions and through the external circ uit by the electrons.
(b)  Aqueous Solutions of Salts
 The electrolysis of aqueous solutions is somewhat more complex. Its reason is the ability 
of water, to be oxidized as well as reduced. Hence, the products of  electrolysis are not precisely 
predictable. Some, metal cations are not discharged from their aqu eous solutions. While, 
electrolyzing aqueous sodium nitrate (NaNO3) solution, sodium ions present are not discharged at 
the cathode. A small concentration of hydronium and hydroxyl ions  arises from the dissociation of 
water:

2 ( ) 3 (aq) (aq)2H O            H O  + OH →1810 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab

 At cathode: +-
3 (aq) (g ) 2 ( ) H O  + e H  + H O → (reduction)
Animation 10.7: Electrolysis

 Subsequently, hydrogen atoms combine rapidly to form hydrogen m olecules at the cathode.
  
   (g) (g) 2(g)H  + H H →
  So, H2 gas evolves at the cathode.
 The concentration of hydronium ions is only 10-7 moles dm-3 in pure water. When these are 
discharged then more are formed by further dissociation of water m olecules. This gives a continuous 
supply of such ions to be discharged. Sodium ions remain in  solution, while hydrogen is evolved 
at the cathode. Thus, the reduction of the solute cations depends on th e relative ease of the two 
competing reactions.
 At the anode, both nitrate and hydroxide ions are present. Hydroxid e ions are easier to 
discharge than nitrate ions. Nitrate ions remain in solution wh ile the electrode reaction is:
 At anode: -
(aq) (aq)OH    OH  + e−→  (oxidation)
 
 The OH groups combine to give O2 gas as follows.
    2(g) 2 ( ) 4OH   O  + 2H O → (anode)
 
 So, O2 gas evolves at the anode.
 
 But, remember that the expected order of the discharge of ions may a lso depend upon their 
concentrations.
10.2.4 Electrolytic Processes of Industrial Importanc e
 Various types of electrolytic cels are employed on industrial scal e. Some of the important 
ones are given here.
(i)  Extraction of sodium by the electrolysis of fused sodium ch loride is carried out in Down’s cell. 
In this case, molten sodium chloride is electrolyzed between iron cath ode and graphite anode. The 
cell is planted to get sodium metal commercially chlorine is obtai ned as a by product.

cathode.
(iii) Magnesium and calcium metals are extracted by the electroly sis of their fused chlorides. Mg 
and Ca are collected at cathodes while Cl2 at anodes
(iv) Aluminium is extracted by electrolyzing fused bauxite, Al2O32H2O in the presence of fused 
cryolite, Na3AlF6. This process is called Hall-Beroult process.
(v) Anodized aluminium is prepared by making it an anode in  an electrolytic cell containing sulphuric 
acid or chromic acid, which coats a thin layer of oxide on- i t. The aluminium oxide layer resists 
attack for corrosive agents. The freshly anodized aluminium is h ydrated and can absorb dyes.2110 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
(vi) Electrolyticcell can also be used for the puriication of copper . Impure copper is made the 
anode and a thin sheet of pure copper is made the cathode. Copper su lphate solution is used as 
an electrolyte. The atoms of Cu from impure Cu- anode are converted to Cu2+ions and migrate 
to cathode which is made up of pure Cu. In this way Cu anode i s puriied. Impurities are left at 
anode.
(vii) Copper, silver, nickel and chromium plating is done by various types of electrolytic cells. One 
metal is deposited at the surface of another metal.
10.2.5 Voltaic or Galvanic Cell
 A voltaic or a galvanic cell consists of two half-cells that ar e electrically connected. Each half 
cell is a portion of the total cell in which a half reaction takes place. Fig. (10.2) shows such a galvanic 
cell. The left half cell consists of a strip of zinc metal dipp ed in 1.0 M solution of zinc sulphate giving 
the following equilibrium:

 The right half-cell is a copper metal strip that dips into 1 .0 M copper sulphate solution and the 
equilibrium here is represented as follows:
   2+ -Cu(s)      Cu +2e →
These half-cells in Fig (10.2) are connected electrically by a  salt bridge. If the solutions were to mix, 
direct chemical reactions would take place, destroying the half-cel ls. The salt bridge contains an 
aqueous solution of potassium chloride in a gel. Zinc tends to lose electrons more readily than 
copper.
 Zn electrode takes on a negative charge relative to the copper electrode. If the external circuit 
is closed by connecting the two electrodes as shown in the igure, electr ons low from the zinc 
through the external circuit to copper electrode. The following half-c ell reactions occur at two 
electrodes and cell potential at standard conditions is 1.1volts . I t is denoted by E°.

Function of Salt Bridge
 Let us, examine the purpose of the salt bridge. Since, zinc ion s are produced as electrons 
leave the anode, we have a process which tends to produce a net positi ve charge in the left beaker. 
Actually, the concentration of Zn2+ ions increase in the left compartment. Similarly, the arrival of th e 
electrons at the copper cathode and their reaction with copper ions tend  to produce a net negative 
charge in the right beaker.
 The purpose of the salt bridge is to prevent any net charge accumu lation in either beaker 
by allowing negative ions to leave the right beaker, difuse through the bridge and enter the left 
beaker. If this difusional exchange of ions does not occur, the net charge accumulating in the 
beakers would immediately stop the low of electrons through the external c ircuit and the oxidation-
reduction reaction would stop.
 Many other oxidation - reduction reactions can be carried out s uccessfully in galvanic cells 
using diferent electrodes. It is natural to think of these cell process es as separated into two half-
reactions which occur at the two electrodes. In a voltaic cell the electri c current in the external 
circuit can be used to light a bulb, drive a motor and so on.
Voltaic Cell is Reversible Cell
 On the other hand, if the external circuit is replaced by a sour ce of electricity that opposes 
the voltaic cell, the electrode reactions can be reversed. Now, the external  source pushes the 
electrons in the opposite direction and supplies energy or work to the c ell so that the reverse non-
spontaneous reaction occurs. Such, a cell is called a reversib le cell.
 For the zinc-copper cell, the half cell reactions are reversed to g ive.
 2+ -
(aq) (s) Zn +2e Zn →     (reduction)
 2+ -
(s)Cu       Cu +2e →    (oxidation)
and the overall reaction being reversed, becomes
    2+ 2
(aq) (s) (s) (aq)Zn  + Cu  Zn  + Cu+→2510 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
 Oxidation occurs at the copper electrode and reduction takes plac e at the zinc electrode 
and the cell operates as an electrolytic cell in which energy from  an external source drives a non-
spontaneous reaction.
 When a cell operates as a voltaic the electrode at which reduction occu rs is called the cathode 
while the electrode at which oxidation takes place is called the an ode. Hence in voltaic cell, Zn acts 
as an anode and Cu acts as a cathode.
10.3.0 ELECTRODE POTENTIAL
 When a metal strip is placed in a solution of its own ions, ther e are two tendencies. The metal 
atoms may dissolve as positive ions. In this way, the electrons a re deposited on the metal electrode. 
On the other hand, the metal ions present in solution may take up elec trons from the metal and get 
discharged as atoms.
 It imparts a positive charge to the metal. In either case, a potential diference is set up between 
the metal and the solution, which is called single electrode potential . 
 The potential set up when an electrode is in contact with one molar sol ution of its own ions 
at 298 K is known as standard electrode potential or standard redu ction potential of the element. 
It is represented as E°.
 Standard electrode potential of hydrogen has arbitrarily been chos en as zero, while the 
standard electrode potentials of other elements can be found by compari ng them with standard 
hydrogen electrode potential. The electrode potential, set up when a meta l piece is placed in a 
solution containing its own ions, can be explained in terms of eq uilibrium between the atoms of 
the metal and its ions in solution. It is believed that when a metal is placed in a solution, some of its 
atoms tend to give electrons to the piece of metal and pass into the solution a s positively charged 
ions. 
 At the same time the metallic ions already present in solution tend to take up electrons from 
the piece of metal and deposit themselves as neutral atoms. Whichever  tendency is greater in a 
given case determines w hether the metal becomes negatively or positivel y charged, compared 
with the solution. When equilibrium is eventually attained, the two op posing processes continue at 
the same rate and there is no further change in the potential diference.2610 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
A rod of zinc , for example, will bear an accumulation of n egative charges. This is due to the net 
ionization of some of its atoms. The negative charge on the Zn-rod will  attract an atmosphere 
of positively charged zinc ions around the rod to form an electric al double layer as shown in Fig. 
(10.3). The equilibrium can, therefore, be represented as:

10.3.1 Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)
 A standard hydrogen electrode which is used as a standard is  shown in Fig. (10.4). It consists 
of a piece of platinum foil, which is coated electrolytically with  inely divided platinum black, to give 
it a large surface area and suspended in one molar solution of H Cl.

Pure hydrogen gas at one atmosphere pressure is continuously bub bled into 1M HCl solution. The 
platinum acts as an electrical conductor and also facilitates th e attainment of equilibrium between 
the gas and its ions in solution. The potential of this electrode is a rbitrarily taken as zero.
10.3.2 Measurement of Electrode Potential
 In any measurement of electrode potential, the concerned electrode is joi ned electrolytically 
with the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and a galvanic cell i s established. The two solutions are 
separated by a porous partition or a salt bridge containing a con centrated solution of potassium 
chloride. The salt bridge is used to provide a highly conducting  path between the two electrolytic 
solutions. The potential diference is measured by a voltmeter which gi ves the potential of the 
electrode, as the potential of SHE is zero. An oxidation or reduction m ay take place at SHE depending 
upon the nature of the electrode which is coupled with it.

 To measure the electrode potential of zinc, a galvanic cell is establ ished between zinc electrode 
dipped in 1 M solution of its ions and standard hydrogen electrod e at 25 °C as shown in Fig (10.5). 
Under the standard conditions, the voltmeter reads 0.76 volts and the delec tion is in such a 
direction as to indicate that zinc has a greater tendency to give of elec trons than hydrogen has. In 
other words, the half reaction 2+ -
(s)Zn       Zn +2e → has greater tendency to occur than +-
2(g)H 2H  + 2e →  
by 0.76 volts. The standard electrode potential of zinc is, therefore,  0.76 volts. It is called oxidation 
potential of Zn and is given the positive sign.
The reduction potential Zn-electrode is -0.76 volt. The electrode reactions  will be shown as follows.

The electrode potential of copper can 
also be measured using the same type 
of galvanic cell in which copper is an 
electrode dipped in 1 M solution of its ions 
and connected with .SHE Fig (10.6). Under 
standard conditions, the voltmeter reads 
0.34 volts and the delection is in such a 
direction, as to indicate that hydrogen has a 
greater tendency to give of electrons than 
copper has.
     In other words, the half reaction 
+-
2(g)H 2H  + 2e →  has a greater tendency to 
occur than 2+ -
(s)Cu Cu +2e →  by 0.34 volt. So 
the standard electrode potential of Cu is 
0.34 volts. It is called reduction potential 
of Cu. When the sign is reversed, then the 
-0.34 V is called oxidation potential of Cu electrode. The reactions  taking place at two electrodes 
will be shown as follows.

10.4 THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SERIES
 When elements are arranged in the order of their standard, electrod e potentials on the 
hydrogen scale, the resulting list is known as electrochemical series.
 Such a series of elements is shown in Table (10.2). The electrod e potentials have been given 
in the reduction mode as recommended by the International Union of P ure and Applied Chemists 
(IUPAC). In some textbooks, half reactions are written in the oxidati on mode and the corresponding 
potentials are oxidation potentials. The magnitude of the potential is not afected by the change 
in mode but the signs are reversed. Therefore, before using standard  electrode potential data, 
it is necessary to ascertain which mode is being used. An impor tant point to remember in using 
reduction potential values is that they relate only to standard conditions  i.e. 1 M solution of ions, 
25°C and one atmospheric pressure. Changes in temperature, conce ntration and pressure will 
afect the values of reduction potential.

10.4.1 Applications of Electrochemical Series
(i)  Prediction of the feasibility of a Chemical Rea ction
 When we look at the electrochemical series, it is easy to predict w hether a particular reaction 
will take place or not. For example, Cu2+ (aq) can oxidize solid zinc but Zn2+ (aq) cannot oxidize solid 
copper. Standard reduction potential values of copper and zinc can  explain this
   2+ - o
(aq) (s ) Cu  + 2e Cu                            E =+0 .34volt →
   2+ - o
(aq) (s) Zn + 2e Zn                            E = -0 .76 volts →
 Since zinc is being oxidized so the reverse reaction will be cons idered.
   2+ - o
(s) (aq)Zn       Zn  + 2e           E = -0.76 volts (oxidation) →
 The overall reaction will thus be
   2+ 2 o
(aq) (s) (s) (aq) cellCu  + Zn u Zn                     E = 1.10 vo lts C+→+
 The overall positive value for the reaction potential suggests that the p rocess is energetically 
feasible. If the sum of E° values of the two half cell reactions i s negative, then the reaction will not 
be feasible.
(ii)  Calculation of the Voltage or Electromotive Fo rce (emf) of Cells:
 In a galvanic cell, the electrode occupying a higher position i n the electrochemical series, will 
act as anode and oxidation takes place on it. Similarly, the el ectrode occupying the lower position 
in the series will act as a cathode and reduction will take plac e on it. Let us ind out a cell potential 
or the emf of the cell already discussed as above. The half cel l reactions are:3410 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
                           2+ -
(s) (aq)Zn      Zn  + 2e →    (oxidation half reaction)
   2+ -
(aq) (s)Cu  + 2e Cu →   (reduction half reaction)
  2+ 2
(aq) (s) (s ) (aq) Cu  + Zn u Zn C+→+    (complete cell reaction)
The oxidation potential of Zn is positive. The reduction potential of Cu2+ is also positive. The cell 
voltage or emf of the cell is given by
    oo o
cell oxi redE = E  + E
    o
cellE = 0.76 + 0.34 = 1.10 volts
 The cell voltage or emf measures the force with which electrons move in the external circuit 
and therefore measures the tendency of the cell reaction to takes place. Galvanic cells, thus, give 
quantitative measure of the relative tendency of the various reactions to occu r.
(iii)  Comparison of Relative Tendency of Metals an d Nonmetals to Get Oxidized or 
Reduced
 The value of the reduction potential of a metal or a nonmetal tells us  the tendency to lose 
electrons and act as a reducing agent. It also gives the information  about the tendency of a species 
to gain electrons and act as an oxidizing agent. Greater the value of  standard reduction potential of 
a given species, greater is its tendency to accept electrons to under go reduction and hence to act 
as an oxidizing agent. For example, ions like Au3+, Pt2+, Hg2+, Ag+, Cu2+ and the nonmetals elements 
like F2, Cl2, Br2 and I2 which lie below the SHE, have a strong tendency to gain electrons a nd undergo 
reduction.
 The series tell us that strong oxidizing agents like F2, Cl2, Br2, etc. have a large positive value 
of standard reduction potentials, while strong reducing agents ha ve large negative values like Li, K, 
Ca, Na,etc. which lie above SHE.3510 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
(iv)  Relative Chemical Reactivity of Metals
 Greater the value of standard reduction potential of a metal, smaller is its tendency to lose 
electrons to change into a positive ion and hence lower will be its re activity. For example, metals like 
Li, Na, K and Rb are highly reactive. Coinage metals, Cu, Ag, and Au are the least reactive because 
they have positive reduction potentials.
 Similarly, metals like Pb, Sn, Ni, Co and Cd which are very close to SHE react very slowly with 
steam to liberate hydrogen gas, while the metals like Fe, Cr, Z n, Mn, Al and Mg which have more 
negative reduction potentials react with steam to produce the metallic oxid es and hydrogen gas.
(v)  Reaction of Matels with Dilute Acids
 Greater the value of standard reduction potential of a metal, lesser is  its tendency to lose 
electrons to form metal ions and so weaker is its tendency to displac e H+ ions from acids as H2 gas. 
For example, metals like Au, Pt, Ag and Cu which have suicien tly high positive values of reduction 
potentials, do not liberate hydrogen gas from acids. While, metals like Zn, Mg and Ca which are 
close to the top of the series and have very low reduction potentials, lib erate hydrogen gas, when 
they react with acids.
(vi)  Displacement of One Metal by Another from its Solution
 One metal will displace another metal from the aqueous solution of i ts salt if it lies above in 
the electrochemical series. For example, Fe can displace Cu fr om CuSO4, Zn does not displace Mg 
from solution of MgSO4.3610 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
10.5 MODERN BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS
 Those cells which cannot be recharged are called primary cel ls. Examples are dry cell, alkaline 
battery, mercury and silver battery. Those ones which can be recha rged are called secondary cells. 
Examples are lead-acid battery, Ni-Cd-battery and fuel cells. A few examples of some modern bat -
teries and fuel cell are described in this section.
10.5.1 Lead Accumulator or Lead-Acid Battery (Recharg eable)
It is commonly used as a car battery. It is secondary or a stor age cell. Passing a direct current 
through it must charge it. The charged cell can then produce elec tric current when required. The 
cathode of a fully charged lead accumulator is lead oxide, PbO2 and its anode is metallic lead. The 
electrolyte is 30% sulphuric acid solution (density 1.25 g cm-3). When the two electrodes are con -
nected through an external circuit, it produces electricity by dis charge Fig (10.7). A single cell pro -
vides around 2 volts. For 12 volts, 6 cells are connected in series.

Discharging
 At the anode the lead atoms release two electrons each to be oxidized to Pb2+ ions, which 
combine with SO42- ions present in the electrolyte and get deposited on the anode as PbSO4.
At the cathode

 The electrons released pass round an external circuit as an electr ic current to be used for 
starting the engine of a vehicle, for lighting up of car lig hts and so on.
 At the cathode the electrons from the anode are accepted by PbO2 and hydrogen ions from 
the electrolyte then undergo a redox reaction to produce lead ions and wa ter as follows: 
 The Pb2 ions then combine with the SO42 ions and they both deposit at the cathode as PbSO4. 
When both electrodes are completely covered with PbSO4 deposits, the cell will cease to discharge 
any more current until it is recharged. The overall reaction is
   + 2-
(s) 2(s) (aq) 4 (aq) 4(s) 2 ( )Pb  + PbO  + 4H  + 2SO 2PbSO  + 2H O →
A typical 12-V car battery has six cells connected in series . Each delivers 2V Each cell contains two 
lead grids packed with the electrode materials. The anode is spon gy lead , and cathode is powered 
PbO4. The grid is immersed in an electrolytic solution of 3.2M≈  H2SO4 (30%). Fibre glass sheets 
between the grids prevent shorting by accidental physic al contact.  When the cell is discharged, it 
generates electrical energy as a voltaic cell.
Recharging
 During the process of recharging, the anode and the cathode of the ex ternal electrical source 
are connected to the anode and the cathode of the cell respectively. Th e redox reactions at the 
respective electrodes are then reversed. These reactions are summarized a s follows:3910 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
At anode   2-
4(s) (s) 4 (aq)PbSO  + 2e Pb  + SO →    (reduction)
At cathode  + 2- -

The overall reaction is
   + 2-
4(s) 2 (s ) 2(s) (aq) 4 (aq) 2PbSO  + 2H O Pb PbO + 4H  + SO →+
During  the process of discharging, the concentration of the acid falls decreasing its density to 1.15g 
cm3. After recharging, the acid is concentrated again bringing i ts density to its initial value of 1.25g 
cm3. At the same time the voltage of the battery, which has dropped duri ng discharging, return to 
around 12 volts.
10.5.2 Alkaline Battery (non-rechargeable)
 It is a dry alkaline cell, which uses zinc and mangan ese dioxide as reactants. Zinc rod serves 
as the anode and manganese dioxide functions as the cathode. The electrolyte, however, contains 
potassium hydroxide and is therefore basic (alkaline).
The battery is enclosed in a steel container. The zinc anode is al so slightly porous giving it a larger 
efective area. This allows the cell to deliver more current than the common  dry cell. It has also 
longer life. The reactions in the alkaline battery.are shown as f ollows:

 These tiny and rather expensive batteries Fig. 10.8 have become popular as power sources 
in electronic watches, auto exposure cameras and electronic calcu lators. The cathode is of silver 
oxide, Ag,0, and the anode is of zinc metal. The following reacti ons occur in a basic electrolyte.

battery. It is a rechargeable cell. The anode is composed of cad mium, which undergoes oxidation in 
an alkaline electrolyte.

The net cell reaction during the discharge is :

 Just like lead storage cell, the solid reaction products adhere to the electrodes. For  this reason, 
the reaction is easily reversed during recharging. Because no ga ses are produced during either 
charging or discharging, the battery can be sealed. It is use d in battery operated tools and portable 
computers. It also inds its application in cordless razors, ph otolash units. It is light weight. Voltage 
of the cell is 1.4 V.
10.5.5 Fuel Cells (rechargeable)
 Fuel cells are other means by which chemical energy may be converted into electrical energy. 
When gaseous fuels, such as hydrogen and oxygen are allowed to undergo a reaction, electrical 
energy can be obtained.
 This cell inds importance in space vehicles. The cell is ill ustrated in Fig. (10.10). The electrodes 
are hollow tubes made of porous compressed carbon impregnated with platinum, which acts as 
a catalyst. The electrolyte is KOH. At the electrodes, hydrogen is ox idized to water and oxygen is 
reduced to hydroxide ions.

KEY POINTS
1. Electrochemistry is the branch of science which deals with the con version of electrical energy to 
chemical energy and vice versa.
2. Electrolytic conduction is carried out by the ions produced when a n ionic compound is in fused 
state or dissolved in water. Electrolysis is the process in which  a chemical reaction takes place at 
the expense of electrical energy. Electrolysis is used for the extracti on of elements and for the 
commercial preparation of several compounds. It is also used for electroplating.
3. A Galvanic or a voltaic cell produces electrical energy at the expense of chemical energy. Electrode 
potential is developed when a metal is dipped into a solution of its own ions.
4. The potential of standard hydrogen electrode is arbitrarily ixed as  0.00 volts. Electrode potential 
of an element is measured when it is coupled with standard hydr ogen electrode. When elements 
are arranged in order of their standard electrode potentials on the hyd rogen scale, the resulting 
list is known as electrochemical series. Electrochemical series  is used to predict the feasibility of 
a redox chemical reaction.
5. Modern batteries and fuel cell include lead accumulator, alkal ine battery, silver oxide battery, 
nickel cadmium cell and hydrogen oxygen fuel cell.
6. The oxidation number is the apparent charge which an atom has  in a molecule. Redox chemical 
equations can be balanced using oxidation number method and ion  electron method.4610 ELECTROCHEMISTRY eLearn.Punjab
